                            RCA is a record label that is used worldwide and currently owned by Sony Music Entertainment.
                            The name RCA refers to the Radio Corporation Of America (RCA), a US electronic and communications company formed in 1919. In 1929, RCA acquired the Victor Talking Machine Co. The Victor Company had released records on the Victor and Victrola labels. The record division became known as RCA Victor until late 1968, when it became RCA Records.
                            In 1985, RCA Records became part of RCA/Ariola International; At the end of that year, General Electric purchased the RCA Corporation; In 1986, GE sold the remainder of RCA Records to Bertelsmann (Ariola's owner) and formed the Bertelsmann Music Group (BMG).
                            Since then, RCA Records has switched owners twice. First it became a label of Sony BMG Music Entertainment and currently is owned by Sony Music Entertainment.
                            On September 26, 2011, Sony Music Entertainment reorganized the RCA Records group into its own label banner. Therefore, the labels under that group, Jive, Arista, LaFace and J Records, were all merged into RCA, bringing all of its artists from these aforementioned four imprints to the RCA family. Furthermore, reissues from Jive, Arista, J and LaFace by Sony will be handled by RCA as well.",

            "description" => "Mercury is one of the oldest labels of the Universal Music Group. It was launched in 1945 by Irving Green, Berle Adams and Arthur Talmadge of the Mercury Record Corporation of Chicago, Illinois.
                            In 1961 the Dutch company Philips Phonografische Industrie (PPI), having lost its distribution deal with Columbia Records outside North America, signed an exchange agreement with Mercury, and PPI subsequently bought the Mercury Record Corporation and its labels to expand its US base. This meant that the Mercury label was now marketed worldwide via PPI's affiliated record companies (mostly Phonogram companies). In the US, Mercury was distributed by Phonodisc, Inc. from 1 June 1975.
                            In 1962 PPI formed a joint-venture with Deutsche Grammophon GmbH and ten years later they merged to form PolyGram. Mercury became one of Polygram's flagship labels.
                            In December 1998, after Seagram acquired Polygram, Mercury became part of the Universal Music Group with the takeover effective from January 1999.
                            Since its reactivation from 2007 to 2013, the label operated via The Island Def Jam Music Group in the US and by Mercury Records Ltd. in the UK. Recently, the label has also been revived by Universal Music France.
                            In the UK, the label has been known as the Mercury Music Group from approximately 2007 to 2011.
                            Since the closure of the Island Def Jam Music Group in April 2014, the label division had been shuttered and phased out once again, this time merging operations with Island Records. The label itself remained in use worldwide.
                            In the US in 2022, Republic Records acquired and relaunched the label with some artists from Republic and and it will continue as their imprint.",

It was initially set up to distribute and market releases on the CBS label overseas, from their US catalog owned by their subsidiary Columbia Records, Inc..
                            This was mainly for Columbia releases due to trademark copyrights. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. couldn't use that brand outside the US, because Electric & Musical Industries Ltd. (EMI) subsidiary Columbia Graphophone Company Ltd. (later The Gramophone Co. Ltd.) owned the rights to the Columbia brand in most of the rest of the world, and Nippon Columbia Co., Ltd. still has the rights to the name in Japan.
                            Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. set up a number of companies to market CBS releases. In Europe, the first to launch was the UK, where the CBS label was launched on May 1, 1962. It was initially distributed by Philips Records Ltd. until the acquisition of Oriole Records Limited in 1964, which was renamed CBS Records Limited. on April 1, 1965, and subsequently took this role. The rest of Europe followed. Greece was in September 1962, Spain in October, Italy, Denmark, Norway, Finland and Sweden were in December 1962, CBS Disques S.A. in France, CBS Grammofoonplaten B.V. in the Netherlands and CBS Schallplatten GmbH in Germany were all in February 1963.
                            South and Central America introduced the CBS label in August 1962 and Asia in July of the same year.
                            In Australia and New Zealand, the CBS label replaced the Coronet (2) label in January 1963.
                            These companies also used the CBS label to release records by locally signed artists.
                            On January 5, 1988, CBS Records, including the sublabels Columbia and Epic, were sold by CBS Inc. (formerly known as Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc.) to Sony Corporation of Japan. CBS Inc. granted Sony Corporation a temporary license to use the CBS brand for three years. Sony Corporation acquired the international rights for Columbia from EMI Records Ltd. on October 15, 1990.
                            Sony Corporation began using Columbia as a worldwide label instead of CBS on January 1, 1991, except in Spain and Japan, where the rights were owned respectively by BMG and Nippon Columbia Co., Ltd. The holding company CBS Records Inc. was renamed Sony Music Entertainment Inc. on the same date. The rights to the CBS brand were returned to CBS Inc. Sony Corporation acquired the rights for Columbia in Spain on August 5, 2004 when Sony BMG Music Entertainment was established.
                            On December 15, 2006, CBS Broadcasting Inc., the successor of CBS Inc., revived the CBS Records brand. The label uses CBS' television networks and its other mass media platforms to market their artists. They also release soundtracks of CBS television shows. The new CBS Records label is not related to the former CBS Records business or its artists or assets.",

                            The label subsequently expanded into Europe where Phil Cheeseman headed its European operations and acted as A&R for various UK-based producers.

They were later joined by Ahmet's brother Nesuhi Ertegun and Jerry Wexler. Growing from literally a one-room operation into one of the preeminent companies in the rapidly evolving music industry, the Atlantic label soon became recognized and revered around the world—a name synonymous with artistry and quality.
                            Atlantic was purchased in 1967 by the Warner Bros-Seven Arts film studio. Atlantic/ATCO Records, along with Warner Bros. Records/Reprise Records, were to be operated as separate record companies under this ownership umbrella. This continued until 1969, when Warner Bros-Seven Arts was purchased by Kinney National Company. Warner Bros. and Atlantic were brought together, Ahmet Ertegün was given considerable power in the new operation and he, along with both the President and Chairman of Warner Bros. Records Mo Austin, served on a committee to oversee the record business. They oversaw the purchase of Elektra from its founder Jac Holzman in 1970, leading to the creation of the Warner-Elektra-Atlantic (WEA) alliance and distribution network.
                            Today, Atlantic remains a part of the Warner Music Group, and forms the Atlantic Music Group along with Elektra, Rhino Records (2) (which Atlantic bought out in 1992) and Lava; EastWest Records America was switched to Elektra when Sylvia Rhone became president of that label in 1995.",

                            The imprint was relaunched in 2010 as a primarily electronic music / dance music label, with Kallman and Gina Tucci as executives.",

                            By 1923, Parlophone proper appears in London administered by English Lindström branch known as The Parlophone Co. Ltd., Parlophon records were pressed in London and sold locally. By 1926 extended operations extended to press for export in Australia (#cat A) until the australian factory Parlophone Co. Ltd. was created somewhere the next year. These companies were subsequently taken over by Columbia Graphophone Company Ltd. in 1927, following its acquisition of Carl Lindström A.-G. in 1926, thus becoming a constituent part of Electric & Musical Industries Ltd. (EMI) when that company merged with The Gramophone Co. Ltd. in 1931.
                            The label largely operated as a Jazz and Novelty label until manager, George Martin, signed the The Beatles in 1962. As a result of its subsequent success and profile, the label was earmarked for phasing out in 1973 in favour of EMI (the label), however the parlophone imprint continued to be used by registered trademark owner EMI Records Ltd. and affiliated companies.
                            In September 2012 following the acquisition of EMI Group Ltd.'s US and Asian interests by Universal Music Group, Parlophone and the former EMI Records Ltd. were merged as the Parlophone Label Group (PLG Holdco Ltd.) and spun off to be sold.

                            RCA is a record label that is used worldwide and currently owned by Sony Music Entertainment.
                            The name RCA refers to the Radio Corporation Of America (RCA), a US electronic and communications company formed in 1919. In 1929, RCA acquired the Victor Talking Machine Co. The Victor Company had released records on the Victor and Victrola labels. The record division became known as RCA Victor until late 1968, when it became RCA Records.
                            In 1985, RCA Records became part of RCA/Ariola International; At the end of that year, General Electric purchased the RCA Corporation; In 1986, GE sold the remainder of RCA Records to Bertelsmann (Ariola's owner) and formed the Bertelsmann Music Group (BMG).
                            Since then, RCA Records has switched owners twice. First it became a label of Sony BMG Music Entertainment and currently is owned by Sony Music Entertainment.
                            On September 26, 2011, Sony Music Entertainment reorganized the RCA Records group into its own label banner. Therefore, the labels under that group, Jive, Arista, LaFace and J Records, were all merged into RCA, bringing all of its artists from these aforementioned four imprints to the RCA family. Furthermore, reissues from Jive, Arista, J and LaFace by Sony will be handled by RCA as well.",

This meant that the Mercury label was now marketed worldwide via PPI's affiliated record companies (mostly Phonogram companies). In the US, Mercury was distributed by Phonodisc, Inc. from 1 June 1975.
                            In 1962 PPI formed a joint-venture with Deutsche Grammophon GmbH and ten years later they merged to form PolyGram. Mercury became one of Polygram's flagship labels.
                            In December 1998, after Seagram acquired Polygram, Mercury became part of the Universal Music Group with the takeover effective from January 1999.
                            Since its reactivation from 2007 to 2013, the label operated via The Island Def Jam Music Group in the US and by Mercury Records Ltd. in the UK. Recently, the label has also been revived by Universal Music France.
                            In the UK, the label has been known as the Mercury Music Group from approximately 2007 to 2011.
                            Since the closure of the Island Def Jam Music Group in April 2014, the label division had been shuttered and phased out once again, this time merging operations with Island Records. The label itself remained in use worldwide.
                            In the US in 2022, Republic Records acquired and relaunched the label with some artists from Republic and and it will continue as their imprint.",

It was initially set up to distribute and market releases on the CBS label overseas, from their US catalog owned by their subsidiary Columbia Records, Inc..
                            This was mainly for Columbia releases due to trademark copyrights. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. couldn't use that brand outside the US, because Electric & Musical Industries Ltd. (EMI) subsidiary Columbia Graphophone Company Ltd. (later The Gramophone Co. Ltd.) owned the rights to the Columbia brand in most of the rest of the world, and Nippon Columbia Co., Ltd. still has the rights to the name in Japan.
                            Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. set up a number of companies to market CBS releases. In Europe, the first to launch was the UK, where the CBS label was launched on May 1, 1962. It was initially distributed by Philips Records Ltd. until the acquisition of Oriole Records Limited in 1964, which was renamed CBS Records Limited. on April 1, 1965, and subsequently took this role. The rest of Europe followed. Greece was in September 1962, Spain in October, Italy, Denmark, Norway, Finland and Sweden were in December 1962, CBS Disques S.A. in France, CBS Grammofoonplaten B.V. in the Netherlands and CBS Schallplatten GmbH in Germany were all in February 1963.
                            South and Central America introduced the CBS label in August 1962 and Asia in July of the same year.
                            In Australia and New Zealand, the CBS label replaced the Coronet (2) label in January 1963.
                            These companies also used the CBS label to release records by locally signed artists.
                            On January 5, 1988, CBS Records, including the sublabels Columbia and Epic, were sold by CBS Inc. (formerly known as Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc.) to Sony Corporation of Japan. CBS Inc. granted Sony Corporation a temporary license to use the CBS brand for three years. Sony Corporation acquired the international rights for Columbia from EMI Records Ltd. on October 15, 1990.
                            Sony Corporation began using Columbia as a worldwide label instead of CBS on January 1, 1991, except in Spain and Japan, where the rights were owned respectively by BMG and Nippon Columbia Co., Ltd. The holding company CBS Records Inc. was renamed Sony Music Entertainment Inc. on the same date. The rights to the CBS brand were returned to CBS Inc. Sony Corporation acquired the rights for Columbia in Spain on August 5, 2004 when Sony BMG Music Entertainment was established.
                            On December 15, 2006, CBS Broadcasting Inc., the successor of CBS Inc., revived the CBS Records brand. The label uses CBS' television networks and its other mass media platforms to market their artists. They also release soundtracks of CBS television shows. The new CBS Records label is not related to the former CBS Records business or its artists or assets.",

                            The label subsequently expanded into Europe where Phil Cheeseman headed its European operations and acted as A&R for various UK-based producers.
                            A short-lived UK subsidiary Strictly Rhythm UK existed in 2001.

                            Strictly Rhythm folded in October 2002 after entering into a venture with Warner Music Group nine months earlier. After four years of legal wrangling, Mark Finkelstein regained control of the label, its trademark, and its recordings and publishing rights.
                            The label relaunched in 2006 in partnership with Defected with Aaron Ross as A&R manager.

They were later joined by Ahmet's brother Nesuhi Ertegun and Jerry Wexler. Growing from literally a one-room operation into one of the preeminent companies in the rapidly evolving music industry, the Atlantic label soon became recognized and revered around the worldâa name synonymous with artistry and quality.
                            Atlantic was purchased in 1967 by the Warner Bros-Seven Arts film studio. Atlantic/ATCO Records, along with Warner Bros. Records/Reprise Records, were to be operated as separate record companies under this ownership umbrella. This continued until 1969, when Warner Bros-Seven Arts was purchased by Kinney National Company. Warner Bros. and Atlantic were brought together, Ahmet ErtegÃ¼n was given considerable power in the new operation and he, along with both the President and Chairman of Warner Bros. Records Mo Austin, served on a committee to oversee the record business. They oversaw the purchase of Elektra from its founder Jac Holzman in 1970, leading to the creation of the Warner-Elektra-Atlantic (WEA) alliance and distribution network.
                            Today, Atlantic remains a part of the Warner Music Group, and forms the Atlantic Music Group along with Elektra, Rhino Records (2) (which Atlantic bought out in 1992) and Lava; EastWest Records America was switched to Elektra when Sylvia Rhone became president of that label in 1995.",

                            By 1923, Parlophone proper appears in London administered by English LindstrÃ¶m branch known as The Parlophone Co. Ltd., Parlophon records were pressed in London and sold locally. By 1926 extended operations extended to press for export in Australia (#cat A) until the australian factory Parlophone Co. Ltd. was created somewhere the next year. These companies were subsequently taken over by Columbia Graphophone Company Ltd. in 1927, following its acquisition of Carl LindstrÃ¶m A.-G. in 1926, thus becoming a constituent part of Electric & Musical Industries Ltd. (EMI) when that company merged with The Gramophone Co. Ltd. in 1931.
                            The label largely operated as a Jazz and Novelty label until manager, George Martin, signed the The Beatles in 1962. As a result of its subsequent success and profile, the label was earmarked for phasing out in 1973 in favour of EMI (the label), however the parlophone imprint continued to be used by registered trademark owner EMI Records Ltd. and affiliated companies.

            "profile" => "Franco Battiato, born Francesco Battiato (Ionia, March 23, 1945 - Milo, May 18, 2021), was an Italian singer-songwriter, composer, musician, and painter.
                        An internationally known artist, Franco Battiato has been everything in his long career, from beat singer to avantgarde performer, producer, contemporary music composer.
                        His beginnings lay in the mid 60's, with many singles released with no particular success, the first two under his real name of Francesco. He had left the native Sicily moving to Milan around 1965.
                        In 1970 after his collaboration with Osage Tribe (that he quit before their only album Arrowhead) he had a record deal with Bla Bla, releasing his first solo album in 1972. 'Fetus', housed in a outrageous cover (reproducing a foetus) was definitely a prog album, but a very original one, with a minimalist sound mainly based on the use of a VCS3 synth, unusual lyrics, complex arrangements. Two tracks, 'Energia' and 'Una Cellula' were also released as single.
                        Second album 'Pollution' followed the same route, but the sound was a bit richer with a larger use of traditional rock instruments. A good concert activity led to Battiato being very popular as an alternative artist and Pollution even reached the Top Ten italian chart. These two albums are considered their best (and most musically accessible) from prog fans.
                        With third album, Sulle corde di 'Aries', the sound shifted toward a more avantgarde style, but the long 'Aria Di Rivoluzione' remains one of his best tracks from the first period.
                        Fourth album 'Clic' was mainly instrumental, with just a single vocal track, 'No U Turn', and it also had an english release on the prestigious Island label, though this album contains different versions of tracks originally included in '-'Sulle Corde Di Aries' and the italian issue of 'Clic'. His first solo album had also been recorded in an english version, entitled 'Foetus', but this was never released at the time and only appeared on CD recently.
                        With 1975's 'M.lle Le Gladiator' we're in full avantgarde music, the album even contains a long church organ solo performance and is a very difficult listen. After the Bla Bla's demise the following releases up to 1978 were all in the same direction, with long instrumental piano or synth performances closer to contemporary music than to progressive.
                        1979 saw the first radical turn, with the new wave-inspired album 'L'Era Del Cinghiale Bianco' that began a fruitful collaboration with violinist Giusto Pio. The album was a big hit and later works followed the same style, with very good arrangements and highly inspired and original lyrics. From late 1980's until today Battiato is still one of the leading figures in italian music.",

As a teen he would freestyle rap on the streets of Brooklyn. After making a demo tape with neighborhood friends and connections, this demo was eventually received DJ Mister Cee (from Big Daddy Kane). From there he got notice in Hip-Hop magazine, The Source, in the Unsigned Hype section. Sean 'Puffy' Combs got a hold of the demo tape and after meeting signed Biggie to Uptown Records. Puffy eventually started his own music label, Bad Boy Records, bringing Biggie with him. Soon after Bad Boy's premiere he released the album, Ready To Die, eventually selling over 4 million copies. To this day B.I.G. is regarded as one of the best lyricist ever in Hip-Hop along with his one time friend and eventual adversary, Tupac Shakur.",

Towards the end of the eighties he acquired his first sequencer, packed away his turntables and turned his hand to producing.
                        Following a series of dancefloor tracks recorded for the now defunct Lower East Side Records under the monniker of Frequency in the early nineties (Where Is Your Evidence, Kiss The Skyâ¦), he was introduced to Juan Atkins (Industrial Metal, Game One) and went on to work with both Derrick May and Blake Baxter (as one half of the Ghetto Brothers). Voorn was also recording as Nighttripper (Tone Exploitation), Format (Solid Session - one of the most sought after classic techno records until its re-release in 1998), Basic Bastard, The Living Room, Baruka, Fix (Flash on Kevin Saunderson's legendary KMS label), Dope Dog, Boy (Paco Di Bango's World) and Stalker (The Stalker/The Riderman)â¦ Many of these tracks can be heard on the double cd Best of Nightvision.
                        Having made his mark producing his own vision of techno, ambient and hiphop and adamantly sidestepping genre limitations thus far, Voorn's announcement that his 'Redeye' album would see a foray into drum'n'bass territory aroused both anticipation and curiosity. While Voorn undoubtedly has an ear for melody, this has always been combined with an innate understanding of the importance of atmosphere and tension in music. Like Squarepusher, Amon Tobin, and Photek, he uses drum'n'bass rhythms to create something beyond pure dance music.",

            "profile" => "English electronic music band formed March 1980 in Basildon, Essex, and named after a popular French fashion magazine. The group's original line-up consisted of Dave Gahan (lead vocals, occasional songwriter since 2005) Martin Gore (keyboards, guitar, vocals, chief songwriter after 1981) Andy Fletcher (keyboards) and Vince Clarke (keyboards, and chief songwriter from 1980 until 1981).
                        Depeche Mode released their debut record 'Speak & Spell,' in 1981, bringing them into the British new-wave scene. Soon after the release of the album, Clarke decided to quit the band, leaving them to record their next album, 1982's 'A Broken Frame,' as a trio. Gore took over lead songwriting duties and, later in 1982, Alan Wilder (keyboards, drums, occasional songwriter) officially joined the band to fill Clarke's spot, thus establishing a line-up that would continue for the next thirteen years.
                        1983's groundbreaking 'Construction Time Again,' and 1984's 'Some Great Reward,' gained the band extensive popularity in the US. The subsequent releases of 1986's 'Black Celebration,' and 1987's 'Music for the Masses,' established them as a dominant force on the mainstream electronic music scene. A highlight of this era was the band's concert at the Pasadena Rose Bowl, titled '101,' where they drew a crowd in excess of 60,000 people. The latter end of the US tour was recorded and released on VHS video, and was titled '101.' The show itself was recorded and released as a double live album, and carried the same title.
                        In the new decade, Depeche Mode released 1990's 'Violator,' which was a massive mainstream success. The subsequent album, 1993's 'Songs of Faith and Devotion,' and the supporting 'Devotional Tour,' exacerbated tensions within the band to the point where Alan Wilder quit in 1995, leading to intense media and fan speculation that the band would split.
                        Now a trio once again, the band released 'Ultra,' in 1997. This album was recorded during the height of Dave Gahan's near-fatal drug abuse, Martin Gore's alcoholism and seizures, along with Andrew Fletcher's bout with serious depression. For these reasons, there was no worldwide tour for this album. In 1998, the band released 'The Singles 81 > 85,' which was a re-issue of 1985's 'The Singles 81 â 85.' The latter release contained 'Photographic (Some Bizarre Version)' & 'Just Can't Get Enough (Schizo Remix).'
                        They also released 'The Singles 86>98,' and there was a subsequent world tour, titled 'The Singles Tour.'
                        The release of 2001's 'Exciter,' confirmed Depeche Mode's willingness to remain together, the subsequent, and very successful. The 'Exciter Tour,' was their first tour in support of an original album since 1993. Again, the band did tour in 1998 to support the aforementioned 'The Singles 86-98,' compilation albums.
                        Depeche Mode have had fifty songs in the UK Singles Chart and thirteen top 10 albums in the UK charts, two of which debuted at No. 1. Depeche Mode have to this day sold over 100 million records worldwide, making them one of the most commercially successful electronic bands and one of the world's best-selling music artists. Q magazine calls Depeche Mode 'the most popular electronic band the world has ever known,' and included the band in the list of the '50 Bands That Changed the World!' Depeche Mode also rank number 98 on VH1's '100 Greatest Artists Of All Time.'",

            "profile" => "Ricardo Villalobos was born in Santiago de Chile in 1970. Following the military coup in 1973, his parents fled to Darmstadt, Germany, where he began an informal musical education taking in samba, salsa and synth pop. In the early 1980s, Villalobos became an avowed Depeche Mode fanatic and began tinkering with his first Roland SH101 synthesizer while learning various South American percussion instruments.
                        His epiphanic introduction to dance music came in 1988, when Acid House blew into continental Europe from Chicago via the UK and permanently changed the course of German electronic music. Soon after, he DJed his first club gigs and organised illegal warehouse and Autobahn underpass parties, as well as more intimate soirÃ©es in his parent'' basement with visiting legends like Boo Williams and Carl Craig. In 1992 he released his first 1'', while pursuing degrees in law and political science at Darmstadt Technical University. He quit education to concentrate on music full time, which began to pay off following mid-90s releases on Playhouse and subsequent residencies at Frankfurt's The Box and Omen.
                        As the city's flourishing electronic scene moved on from its EBM roots towards newer rave vistas, Villalobo''s deep, Minimal House and Techno morphed from a barebones Rhythm And Sound aesthetic (1999's â808 The Bass Queenâ) to the more confident Halma EP (2002). By the release of his first longplayer Alcachofa in 2003, Minimal Techno had become a recognised genre, and Villalobos one of the most respected practitioners of its Berlin-centric second wave.
                        Since then, his star has continued to rise, both as a DJ of marathon sets and a producer, releasing critically acclaimed LPs and numerous club 12''s. Over the years there has been a shift from his hallucinatory, minimal, conga-inflected sound into a more experimental mode, marked by extended forays into modular synthesis.",

A favourite pupil of Goffredo Petrassi, he also deputized secretly for his trumpeter father in a light music orchestra. He thus developed two distinct sides to his musical personality: one of these led him to embrace serialism and the experimental work of the improvisation group Gruppo di Improvvisazione Nuova Consonanza; the other gained him a leading role, principally as an arranger, in all types of mass-media popular music, including songs for radio, radio and television plays, and the first successful television variety shows.
                        After many minor cinematic collaborations, Morricone achieved wider recognition with Sergio Leone's series of four Westerns. There followed important collaborations with directors such as Bernardo Bertolucci, Pier Paolo Pasolini, Elio Petri, Paolo and Vittorio Taviani, Valerio Zurlini, Roland JoffÃ© and Brian De Palma. Despite inevitable self-repetitions over a total of more than 400 film scores, his work provides many examples of a highly original fusion of classical and popular idioms.
                        Morricone's non-film works form a large and increasingly widely performed part of his output. Many of them use his technique of 'micro-cells', a pseudo-serial approach often incorporating modal and tonal allusions, which, with its extreme reduction of compositional materials, has much in common with his film-music techniques.
                        Among honours, he won the Academy Award in 2016 for his score to Quentin Tarantino's The Hateful Eight and has received five Academy Award nominations between 1979 and 2001, a Grammy and a Leone d'oro, and was awarded the Laurea ad Honorem by the University of Cagliari.

A native of Sardinia, Italy he grew up obsessing over the work of a suitably diverse range of musicians, from Pink Floyd to Aphex Twin to J Dilla and Underground Resistance. Often intersecting the frenetic hack-and-slash action and clunking sounds of arcade games, his many dexterous productions are laced in a dizzying eclecticism. The end result is an intriguing blend of fascinating sound-waves and nano-loops that always keeps the listener's attention firmly intact.
                        Now firmly based in Berlin, Spacetravelâmuch like his alias suggestsâis an individual who has long harboured a deep fascination with all things futuristic. As likely to call on playful house textures as he is more electro-leaning sounds, his innovative and experimental way of working has led him to some of the contemporary scene's most innovative imprints. Since his debut release, the exceptional Galactic dropped via Binh's Time Passages, he has since racked up credits for the likes of So Inagawa's Cabaret, Mellifow, Zip and Nikolai's Perlon as well as his own label, the burgeoning Traveling Without Moving.
                        In 2016, Spacetravel released his debut full-length via Perlon. Entitled Dancing Therapy, the release quickly became another sought-after gem in the label's extensive back catalogue. Touching on a range of topics, moods and sounds, it quite expertly encapsulated all that's great about label and producer. More recently, he also returned to the much-celebrated Perlon courtesy of his track, 'No More', which was featured on the label's Superlongevity 6 V/A alongside celebrated acts such as Ricardo Villalobos, Baby Ford and Margaret Dygas. 2018 has proved another significant year for the Spacetravel, as he returned to Melliflow courtesy of his second LP, the equally enticing Ziusudra.
                        Just as revered a DJ as he is a producer, Spacetravel's intricate DJ style has led him to some of the world's foremost nightspots, including Panorama Bar and Club der Visionaere in Berlin, Robert Johnson in Frankfurt, Concrete in Paris and Arma 17 in Moscow.

It makes me laugh.â

He moved to London in 1993, where he released a slew of albums and EPs on Warp Records and other labels under many aliases.

This followed a brief period with Stuart Sutcliffe (bass, 1960-61) and Pete Best (drums, 1960-62).
                        Initially recognized for their Merseybeat style, the Beatles soon ventured into uncharted musical territories, exploring psychedelia and pioneering innovative production techniques that incorporated tape loops and other effects. Over their active years, they created a legacy of 12 studio albums.
                        Their profound impact on rock and roll was acknowledged in 1988 when they were inducted into the Rock And Roll Hall of Fame as a group. By 2015, each member had also received individual recognition for their contributions as solo artists within the Hall of Fame.",

                        Led Zeppelin formed out of the ashes of The Yardbirds. Jimmy Page had joined the band in its final days, playing a pivotal role on the group's final album, 1967's Little Games, which also featured string arrangements from John Paul Jones. During 1967, the Yardbirds were fairly inactive. Whilst the band members decided the group's future, Page returned to session work in 1967. In the spring of 1968, he played on Jones' arrangement of Donovan's 'Hurdy Gurdy Man.' During the sessions, Jones requested to be part of any future project Page would develop. Page would have to assemble a band sooner than he had planned. In the summer of 1968, the Yardbirds' Keith Relf and Jim McCarty left, leaving Page and bassist Chris Dreja with the rights to the name, as well as the obligation of fulfilling an upcoming fall tour. Page set out to find a replacement vocalist and drummer. Initially, he wanted to enlist singer Terry Reid and Procol Harum's drummer B.J. Wilson, but neither musician was able to join the group. Reid suggested that Page contact Robert Plant, who was singing with a band called Hobbstweedle.

                        The name Radiohead comes from the Talking Heads song, 'Radio Head', from the 'True Stories' album.
                        Formed by school friends in 1986, Radiohead did not release their first single until 1992's 'Drill EP'. The cathartic 'Creep', from the debut album 'Pablo Honey' (1993), became a worldwide hit as grunge music dominated radio airwaves.
                        Radiohead were initially branded as a one-hit wonder abroad, but caught on at home in the UK with their second album, 'The Bends' (1995), earning fans with their dense guitar atmospheres and front man Thom Yorke's expressive singing. The album featured the hits 'High & Dry', 'Just' and 'Fake Plastic Trees'.
                        The band's third album, 'OK Computer' (1997), propelled them to greater attention. Popular both for its expansive sound and themes of modern alienation, the album has been acclaimed by critics as a landmark record of the 1990's, some critics go as far to consider it one of the best of all time. 'Kid A' (2000) marked further evolution, containing influences from experimental electronic music.
                        'Hail To The Thief' (2003) was seen as a conventional return to the guitar and piano-led rock sound. After fulfilling their contract with EMI, Radiohead released 'In Rainbows' (2007) famously via a pay-what-you-want model. Their latest album, 'A Moon Shaped Pool', was released in May 2016.
                        Radiohead's original influences were cited as alternative rock and post-punk bands like The Smiths, Pixies, Magazine, Joy Division and Siouxsie & The Banshees, who Thom Yorke claims inspired him to become a performer, and R.E.M. (with lead singer of the band, Thom Yorke, referring to himself as an 'R.E.M. groupie').",

                        KLF adopted the philosophy espoused by esoteric novel series The Illuminatus! Trilogy, gaining notoriety for various anarchic situationist manifestations, including the defacement of billboard adverts, the posting of prominent cryptic advertisements in NME magazine and the mainstream press, and highly distinctive and unusual performances on Top of the Pops. Their most notorious performance was a collaboration with Extreme Noise Terror at the February 1992 BRIT Awards, where they fired machine gun blanks into the audience and dumped a dead sheep at the aftershow party. This performance announced The KLF's departure from the music business, and in May 1992 the duo deleted their entire back catalogue.
                        With The KLF's profits, Drummond and Cauty established the K Foundation and sought to subvert the art world, staging an alternative art award for the worst artist of the year and burning one million pounds sterling. Although Drummond and Cauty remained true to their word of May 1992âthe KLF Communications catalogue remains deleted in the UKâthey have released a small number of new tracks since then, as the K Foundation, The One World Orchestra and most recently, in 1997, as 2K.
                        The KLF catalogue remained absent from digital platforms until January 1, 2021, when an 8-track compilation of their 7'' hit singles 1988-1991 - Solid State Logik 1 was released on streaming platforms, marking the 1st installment of a series called Samplecity Thru Trancentral.

By 1992, the group was keen on reinventing themselves with a newer, smarter sound and sense of purpose, eschewing the sounds that were coming out of the U.S. specifically, and returning to a retro spectrum of British rock and pop music: British Invasion groups, Mod groups, Psychedelic Rock, even nostalgic music from World War II.

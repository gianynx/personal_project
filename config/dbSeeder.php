                            RCA is a record label that is used worldwide and currently owned by Sony Music Entertainment.
                            The name RCA refers to the Radio Corporation Of America (RCA), a US electronic and communications company formed in 1919. In 1929, RCA acquired the Victor Talking Machine Co. The Victor Company had released records on the Victor and Victrola labels. The record division became known as RCA Victor until late 1968, when it became RCA Records.
                            In 1985, RCA Records became part of RCA/Ariola International; At the end of that year, General Electric purchased the RCA Corporation; In 1986, GE sold the remainder of RCA Records to Bertelsmann (Ariola's owner) and formed the Bertelsmann Music Group (BMG).
                            Since then, RCA Records has switched owners twice. First it became a label of Sony BMG Music Entertainment and currently is owned by Sony Music Entertainment.
                            On September 26, 2011, Sony Music Entertainment reorganized the RCA Records group into its own label banner. Therefore, the labels under that group, Jive, Arista, LaFace and J Records, were all merged into RCA, bringing all of its artists from these aforementioned four imprints to the RCA family. Furthermore, reissues from Jive, Arista, J and LaFace by Sony will be handled by RCA as well.",

                            In 1961 the Dutch company Philips Phonografische Industrie (PPI), having lost its distribution deal with Columbia Records outside North America, signed an exchange agreement with Mercury, and PPI subsequently bought the Mercury Record Corporation and its labels to expand its US base. This meant that the Mercury label was now marketed worldwide via PPI's affiliated record companies (mostly Phonogram companies). In the US, Mercury was distributed by Phonodisc, Inc. from 1 June 1975.
                            In 1962 PPI formed a joint-venture with Deutsche Grammophon GmbH and ten years later they merged to form PolyGram. Mercury became one of Polygram's flagship labels.
                            In December 1998, after Seagram acquired Polygram, Mercury became part of the Universal Music Group with the takeover effective from January 1999.
                            Since its reactivation from 2007 to 2013, the label operated via The Island Def Jam Music Group in the US and by Mercury Records Ltd. in the UK. Recently, the label has also been revived by Universal Music France.
                            In the UK, the label has been known as the Mercury Music Group from approximately 2007 to 2011.
                            Since the closure of the Island Def Jam Music Group in April 2014, the label division had been shuttered and phased out once again, this time merging operations with Island Records. The label itself remained in use worldwide.
                            In the US in 2022, Republic Records acquired and relaunched the label with some artists from Republic and and it will continue as their imprint.",

It was initially set up to distribute and market releases on the CBS label overseas, from their US catalog owned by their subsidiary Columbia Records, Inc..
                            This was mainly for Columbia releases due to trademark copyrights. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. couldn't use that brand outside the US, because Electric & Musical Industries Ltd. (EMI) subsidiary Columbia Graphophone Company Ltd. (later The Gramophone Co. Ltd.) owned the rights to the Columbia brand in most of the rest of the world, and Nippon Columbia Co., Ltd. still has the rights to the name in Japan.
                            Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. set up a number of companies to market CBS releases. In Europe, the first to launch was the UK, where the CBS label was launched on May 1, 1962. It was initially distributed by Philips Records Ltd. until the acquisition of Oriole Records Limited in 1964, which was renamed CBS Records Limited. on April 1, 1965, and subsequently took this role. The rest of Europe followed. Greece was in September 1962, Spain in October, Italy, Denmark, Norway, Finland and Sweden were in December 1962, CBS Disques S.A. in France, CBS Grammofoonplaten B.V. in the Netherlands and CBS Schallplatten GmbH in Germany were all in February 1963.
                            South and Central America introduced the CBS label in August 1962 and Asia in July of the same year.
                            In Australia and New Zealand, the CBS label replaced the Coronet (2) label in January 1963.
                            These companies also used the CBS label to release records by locally signed artists.
                            On January 5, 1988, CBS Records, including the sublabels Columbia and Epic, were sold by CBS Inc. (formerly known as Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc.) to Sony Corporation of Japan. CBS Inc. granted Sony Corporation a temporary license to use the CBS brand for three years. Sony Corporation acquired the international rights for Columbia from EMI Records Ltd. on October 15, 1990.
                            Sony Corporation began using Columbia as a worldwide label instead of CBS on January 1, 1991, except in Spain and Japan, where the rights were owned respectively by BMG and Nippon Columbia Co., Ltd. The holding company CBS Records Inc. was renamed Sony Music Entertainment Inc. on the same date. The rights to the CBS brand were returned to CBS Inc. Sony Corporation acquired the rights for Columbia in Spain on August 5, 2004 when Sony BMG Music Entertainment was established.
                            On December 15, 2006, CBS Broadcasting Inc., the successor of CBS Inc., revived the CBS Records brand. The label uses CBS' television networks and its other mass media platforms to market their artists. They also release soundtracks of CBS television shows. The new CBS Records label is not related to the former CBS Records business or its artists or assets.",

                            The label subsequently expanded into Europe where Phil Cheeseman headed its European operations and acted as A&R for various UK-based producers.
                            A short-lived UK subsidiary Strictly Rhythm UK existed in 2001.

                            Strictly Rhythm folded in October 2002 after entering into a venture with Warner Music Group nine months earlier. After four years of legal wrangling, Mark Finkelstein regained control of the label, its trademark, and its recordings and publishing rights.
                            The label relaunched in 2006 in partnership with Defected with Aaron Ross as A&R manager.

They were later joined by Ahmet's brother Nesuhi Ertegun and Jerry Wexler. Growing from literally a one-room operation into one of the preeminent companies in the rapidly evolving music industry, the Atlantic label soon became recognized and revered around the worldâa name synonymous with artistry and quality.
                            Atlantic was purchased in 1967 by the Warner Bros-Seven Arts film studio. Atlantic/ATCO Records, along with Warner Bros. Records/Reprise Records, were to be operated as separate record companies under this ownership umbrella. This continued until 1969, when Warner Bros-Seven Arts was purchased by Kinney National Company. Warner Bros. and Atlantic were brought together, Ahmet ErtegÃ¼n was given considerable power in the new operation and he, along with both the President and Chairman of Warner Bros. Records Mo Austin, served on a committee to oversee the record business. They oversaw the purchase of Elektra from its founder Jac Holzman in 1970, leading to the creation of the Warner-Elektra-Atlantic (WEA) alliance and distribution network.
                            Today, Atlantic remains a part of the Warner Music Group, and forms the Atlantic Music Group along with Elektra, Rhino Records (2) (which Atlantic bought out in 1992) and Lava; EastWest Records America was switched to Elektra when Sylvia Rhone became president of that label in 1995.",

                            By 1923, Parlophone proper appears in London administered by English LindstrÃ¶m branch known as The Parlophone Co. Ltd., Parlophon records were pressed in London and sold locally. By 1926 extended operations extended to press for export in Australia (#cat A) until the australian factory Parlophone Co. Ltd. was created somewhere the next year. These companies were subsequently taken over by Columbia Graphophone Company Ltd. in 1927, following its acquisition of Carl LindstrÃ¶m A.-G. in 1926, thus becoming a constituent part of Electric & Musical Industries Ltd. (EMI) when that company merged with The Gramophone Co. Ltd. in 1931.
                            The label largely operated as a Jazz and Novelty label until manager, George Martin, signed the The Beatles in 1962. As a result of its subsequent success and profile, the label was earmarked for phasing out in 1973 in favour of EMI (the label), however the parlophone imprint continued to be used by registered trademark owner EMI Records Ltd. and affiliated companies.

            "profile" => "Franco Battiato, born Francesco Battiato (Ionia, March 23, 1945 - Milo, May 18, 2021), was an Italian singer-songwriter, composer, musician, and painter.
                        An internationally known artist, Franco Battiato has been everything in his long career, from beat singer to avantgarde performer, producer, contemporary music composer.
                        His beginnings lay in the mid 60's, with many singles released with no particular success, the first two under his real name of Francesco. He had left the native Sicily moving to Milan around 1965.
                        In 1970 after his collaboration with Osage Tribe (that he quit before their only album Arrowhead) he had a record deal with Bla Bla, releasing his first solo album in 1972. 'Fetus', housed in a outrageous cover (reproducing a foetus) was definitely a prog album, but a very original one, with a minimalist sound mainly based on the use of a VCS3 synth, unusual lyrics, complex arrangements. Two tracks, 'Energia' and 'Una Cellula' were also released as single.
                        Second album 'Pollution' followed the same route, but the sound was a bit richer with a larger use of traditional rock instruments. A good concert activity led to Battiato being very popular as an alternative artist and Pollution even reached the Top Ten italian chart. These two albums are considered their best (and most musically accessible) from prog fans.
                        With third album, Sulle corde di 'Aries', the sound shifted toward a more avantgarde style, but the long 'Aria Di Rivoluzione' remains one of his best tracks from the first period.
                        Fourth album 'Clic' was mainly instrumental, with just a single vocal track, 'No U Turn', and it also had an english release on the prestigious Island label, though this album contains different versions of tracks originally included in '-'Sulle Corde Di Aries' and the italian issue of 'Clic'. His first solo album had also been recorded in an english version, entitled 'Foetus', but this was never released at the time and only appeared on CD recently.
                        With 1975's 'M.lle Le Gladiator' we're in full avantgarde music, the album even contains a long church organ solo performance and is a very difficult listen. After the Bla Bla's demise the following releases up to 1978 were all in the same direction, with long instrumental piano or synth performances closer to contemporary music than to progressive.
                        1979 saw the first radical turn, with the new wave-inspired album 'L'Era Del Cinghiale Bianco' that began a fruitful collaboration with violinist Giusto Pio. The album was a big hit and later works followed the same style, with very good arrangements and highly inspired and original lyrics. From late 1980's until today Battiato is still one of the leading figures in italian music.",

As a teen he would freestyle rap on the streets of Brooklyn. After making a demo tape with neighborhood friends and connections, this demo was eventually received DJ Mister Cee (from Big Daddy Kane). From there he got notice in Hip-Hop magazine, The Source, in the Unsigned Hype section. Sean 'Puffy' Combs got a hold of the demo tape and after meeting signed Biggie to Uptown Records. Puffy eventually started his own music label, Bad Boy Records, bringing Biggie with him. Soon after Bad Boy's premiere he released the album, Ready To Die, eventually selling over 4 million copies.

Towards the end of the eighties he acquired his first sequencer, packed away his turntables and turned his hand to producing.
                        Following a series of dancefloor tracks recorded for the now defunct Lower East Side Records under the monniker of Frequency in the early nineties (Where Is Your Evidence, Kiss The Skyâ¦), he was introduced to Juan Atkins (Industrial Metal, Game One) and went on to work with both Derrick May and Blake Baxter (as one half of the Ghetto Brothers). Voorn was also recording as Nighttripper (Tone Exploitation), Format (Solid Session - one of the most sought after classic techno records until its re-release in 1998), Basic Bastard, The Living Room, Baruka, Fix (Flash on Kevin Saunderson's legendary KMS label), Dope Dog, Boy (Paco Di Bango's World) and Stalker (The Stalker/The Riderman)â¦ Many of these tracks can be heard on the double cd Best of Nightvision.
                        Having made his mark producing his own vision of techno, ambient and hiphop and adamantly sidestepping genre limitations thus far, Voorn's announcement that his 'Redeye' album would see a foray into drum'n'bass territory aroused both anticipation and curiosity. While Voorn undoubtedly has an ear for melody, this has always been combined with an innate understanding of the importance of atmosphere and tension in music. Like Squarepusher, Amon Tobin, and Photek, he uses drum'n'bass rhythms to create something beyond pure dance music.",

            "profile" => "English electronic music band formed March 1980 in Basildon, Essex, and named after a popular French fashion magazine. The group's original line-up consisted of Dave Gahan (lead vocals, occasional songwriter since 2005) Martin Gore (keyboards, guitar, vocals, chief songwriter after 1981) Andy Fletcher (keyboards) and Vince Clarke (keyboards, and chief songwriter from 1980 until 1981).
                        Depeche Mode released their debut record 'Speak & Spell,' in 1981, bringing them into the British new-wave scene. Soon after the release of the album, Clarke decided to quit the band, leaving them to record their next album, 1982's 'A Broken Frame,' as a trio. Gore took over lead songwriting duties and, later in 1982, Alan Wilder (keyboards, drums, occasional songwriter) officially joined the band to fill Clarke's spot, thus establishing a line-up that would continue for the next thirteen years.
                        1983's groundbreaking 'Construction Time Again,' and 1984's 'Some Great Reward,' gained the band extensive popularity in the US. The subsequent releases of 1986's 'Black Celebration,' and 1987's 'Music for the Masses,' established them as a dominant force on the mainstream electronic music scene. A highlight of this era was the band's concert at the Pasadena Rose Bowl, titled '101,' where they drew a crowd in excess of 60,000 people. The latter end of the US tour was recorded and released on VHS video, and was titled '101.' The show itself was recorded and released as a double live album, and carried the same title.
                        In the new decade, Depeche Mode released 1990's 'Violator,' which was a massive mainstream success. The subsequent album, 1993's 'Songs of Faith and Devotion,' and the supporting 'Devotional Tour,' exacerbated tensions within the band to the point where Alan Wilder quit in 1995, leading to intense media and fan speculation that the band would split.
                        Now a trio once again, the band released 'Ultra,' in 1997. This album was recorded during the height of Dave Gahan's near-fatal drug abuse, Martin Gore's alcoholism and seizures, along with Andrew Fletcher's bout with serious depression. For these reasons, there was no worldwide tour for this album. In 1998, the band released 'The Singles 81 > 85,' which was a re-issue of 1985's 'The Singles 81 â 85.' The latter release contained 'Photographic (Some Bizarre Version)' & 'Just Can't Get Enough (Schizo Remix).'
                        They also released 'The Singles 86>98,' and there was a subsequent world tour, titled 'The Singles Tour.'
                        The release of 2001's 'Exciter,' confirmed Depeche Mode's willingness to remain together, the subsequent, and very successful. The 'Exciter Tour,' was their first tour in support of an original album since 1993. Again, the band did tour in 1998 to support the aforementioned 'The Singles 86-98,' compilation albums.
                        Depeche Mode have had fifty songs in the UK Singles Chart and thirteen top 10 albums in the UK charts, two of which debuted at No. 1. Depeche Mode have to this day sold over 100 million records worldwide, making them one of the most commercially successful electronic bands and one of the world's best-selling music artists. Q magazine calls Depeche Mode 'the most popular electronic band the world has ever known,' and included the band in the list of the '50 Bands That Changed the World!' Depeche Mode also rank number 98 on VH1's '100 Greatest Artists Of All Time.'",

            "profile" => "Ricardo Villalobos was born in Santiago de Chile in 1970. Following the military coup in 1973, his parents fled to Darmstadt, Germany, where he began an informal musical education taking in samba, salsa and synth pop. In the early 1980s, Villalobos became an avowed Depeche Mode fanatic and began tinkering with his first Roland SH101 synthesizer while learning various South American percussion instruments.
                        His epiphanic introduction to dance music came in 1988, when Acid House blew into continental Europe from Chicago via the UK and permanently changed the course of German electronic music. Soon after, he DJed his first club gigs and organised illegal warehouse and Autobahn underpass parties, as well as more intimate soirÃ©es in his parent'' basement with visiting legends like Boo Williams and Carl Craig. In 1992 he released his first 1'', while pursuing degrees in law and political science at Darmstadt Technical University. He quit education to concentrate on music full time, which began to pay off following mid-90s releases on Playhouse and subsequent residencies at Frankfurt's The Box and Omen.
                        As the city's flourishing electronic scene moved on from its EBM roots towards newer rave vistas, Villalobo''s deep, Minimal House and Techno morphed from a barebones Rhythm And Sound aesthetic (1999's â808 The Bass Queenâ) to the more confident Halma EP (2002). By the release of his first longplayer Alcachofa in 2003, Minimal Techno had become a recognised genre, and Villalobos one of the most respected practitioners of its Berlin-centric second wave.
                        Since then, his star has continued to rise, both as a DJ of marathon sets and a producer, releasing critically acclaimed LPs and numerous club 12''s. Over the years there has been a shift from his hallucinatory, minimal, conga-inflected sound into a more experimental mode, marked by extended forays into modular synthesis.",

A favourite pupil of Goffredo Petrassi, he also deputized secretly for his trumpeter father in a light music orchestra. He thus developed two distinct sides to his musical personality: one of these led him to embrace serialism and the experimental work of the improvisation group Gruppo di Improvvisazione Nuova Consonanza; the other gained him a leading role, principally as an arranger, in all types of mass-media popular music, including songs for radio, radio and television plays, and the first successful television variety shows.
                        After many minor cinematic collaborations, Morricone achieved wider recognition with Sergio Leone's series of four Westerns. There followed important collaborations with directors such as Bernardo Bertolucci, Pier Paolo Pasolini, Elio Petri, Paolo and Vittorio Taviani, Valerio Zurlini, Roland JoffÃ© and Brian De Palma. Despite inevitable self-repetitions over a total of more than 400 film scores, his work provides many examples of a highly original fusion of classical and popular idioms.
                        Morricone's non-film works form a large and increasingly widely performed part of his output. Many of them use his technique of 'micro-cells', a pseudo-serial approach often incorporating modal and tonal allusions, which, with its extreme reduction of compositional materials, has much in common with his film-music techniques.
                        Among honours, he won the Academy Award in 2016 for his score to Quentin Tarantino's The Hateful Eight and has received five Academy Award nominations between 1979 and 2001, a Grammy and a Leone d'oro, and was awarded the Laurea ad Honorem by the University of Cagliari.

A native of Sardinia, Italy he grew up obsessing over the work of a suitably diverse range of musicians, from Pink Floyd to Aphex Twin to J Dilla and Underground Resistance. Often intersecting the frenetic hack-and-slash action and clunking sounds of arcade games, his many dexterous productions are laced in a dizzying eclecticism. The end result is an intriguing blend of fascinating sound-waves and nano-loops that always keeps the listener's attention firmly intact.
                        Now firmly based in Berlin, Spacetravelâmuch like his alias suggestsâis an individual who has long harboured a deep fascination with all things futuristic. As likely to call on playful house textures as he is more electro-leaning sounds, his innovative and experimental way of working has led him to some of the contemporary scene's most innovative imprints. Since his debut release, the exceptional Galactic dropped via Binh's Time Passages, he has since racked up credits for the likes of So Inagawa's Cabaret, Mellifow, Zip and Nikolai's Perlon as well as his own label, the burgeoning Traveling Without Moving.
                        In 2016, Spacetravel released his debut full-length via Perlon. Entitled Dancing Therapy, the release quickly became another sought-after gem in the label's extensive back catalogue. Touching on a range of topics, moods and sounds, it quite expertly encapsulated all that's great about label and producer. More recently, he also returned to the much-celebrated Perlon courtesy of his track, 'No More', which was featured on the label's Superlongevity 6 V/A alongside celebrated acts such as Ricardo Villalobos, Baby Ford and Margaret Dygas. 2018 has proved another significant year for the Spacetravel, as he returned to Melliflow courtesy of his second LP, the equally enticing Ziusudra.
                        Just as revered a DJ as he is a producer, Spacetravel's intricate DJ style has led him to some of the world's foremost nightspots, including Panorama Bar and Club der Visionaere in Berlin, Robert Johnson in Frankfurt, Concrete in Paris and Arma 17 in Moscow.

It makes me laugh.â

Jimmy Page had joined the band in its final days, playing a pivotal role on the group's final album, 1967's Little Games, which also featured string arrangements from John Paul Jones. During 1967, the Yardbirds were fairly inactive. Whilst the band members decided the group's future, Page returned to session work in 1967. In the spring of 1968, he played on Jones' arrangement of Donovan's 'Hurdy Gurdy Man.' During the sessions, Jones requested to be part of any future project Page would develop. Page would have to assemble a band sooner than he had planned. In the summer of 1968, the Yardbirds' Keith Relf and Jim McCarty left, leaving Page and bassist Chris Dreja with the rights to the name, as well as the obligation of fulfilling an upcoming fall tour. Page set out to find a replacement vocalist and drummer. Initially, he wanted to enlist singer Terry Reid and Procol Harum's drummer B.J. Wilson, but neither musician was able to join the group. Reid suggested that Page contact Robert Plant, who was singing with a band called Hobbstweedle.

                        Formed by school friends in 1986, Radiohead did not release their first single until 1992's 'Drill EP'. The cathartic 'Creep', from the debut album 'Pablo Honey' (1993), became a worldwide hit as grunge music dominated radio airwaves.
                        Radiohead were initially branded as a one-hit wonder abroad, but caught on at home in the UK with their second album, 'The Bends' (1995), earning fans with their dense guitar atmospheres and front man Thom Yorke's expressive singing. The album featured the hits 'High & Dry', 'Just' and 'Fake Plastic Trees'.
                        The band's third album, 'OK Computer' (1997), propelled them to greater attention. Popular both for its expansive sound and themes of modern alienation, the album has been acclaimed by critics as a landmark record of the 1990's, some critics go as far to consider it one of the best of all time. 'Kid A' (2000) marked further evolution, containing influences from experimental electronic music.
                        'Hail To The Thief' (2003) was seen as a conventional return to the guitar and piano-led rock sound. After fulfilling their contract with EMI, Radiohead released 'In Rainbows' (2007) famously via a pay-what-you-want model. Their latest album, 'A Moon Shaped Pool', was released in May 2016.
                        Radiohead's original influences were cited as alternative rock and post-punk bands like The Smiths, Pixies, Magazine, Joy Division and Siouxsie & The Banshees, who Thom Yorke claims inspired him to become a performer, and R.E.M. (with lead singer of the band, Thom Yorke, referring to himself as an 'R.E.M. groupie').",

Their most notorious performance was a collaboration with Extreme Noise Terror at the February 1992 BRIT Awards, where they fired machine gun blanks into the audience and dumped a dead sheep at the aftershow party. This performance announced The KLF's departure from the music business, and in May 1992 the duo deleted their entire back catalogue.
                        With The KLF's profits, Drummond and Cauty established the K Foundation and sought to subvert the art world, staging an alternative art award for the worst artist of the year and burning one million pounds sterling.

                        Jones, who had nurtured the Chicago house renaissance of the 1990s with his Cajual Records, gained success in 1993 with the Cajmere single 'Brighter Days' (with DajaÃ© on vocals).

            "name" => "Electronic music",
            "description" => "Electronic music is a genre of music that employs electronic musical instruments, digital instruments, or circuitry-based music technology in its creation. It includes both music made using electronic and electromechanical means (electroacoustic music). Pure electronic instruments depended entirely on circuitry-based sound generation, for instance using devices such as an electronic oscillator, theremin, or synthesizer. Electromechanical instruments can have mechanical parts such as strings, hammers, and electric elements including magnetic pickups, power amplifiers and loudspeakers. Such electromechanical devices include the telharmonium, Hammond organ, electric piano and the electric guitar.
                            The first electronic musical devices were developed at the end of the 19th century. During the 1920s and 1930s, some electronic instruments were introduced and the first compositions featuring them were written. By the 1940s, magnetic audio tape allowed musicians to tape sounds and then modify them by changing the tape speed or direction, leading to the development of electroacoustic tape music in the 1940s, in Egypt and France. Musique concrÃ¨te, created in Paris in 1948, was based on editing together recorded fragments of natural and industrial sounds. Music produced solely from electronic generators was first produced in Germany in 1953 by Karlheinz Stockhausen. Electronic music was also created in Japan and the United States beginning in the 1950s and Algorithmic composition with computers was first demonstrated in the same decade.
                            During the 1960s, digital computer music was pioneered, innovation in live electronics took place, and Japanese electronic musical instruments began to influence the music industry. In the early 1970s, Moog synthesizers and drum machines helped popularize synthesized electronic music. The 1970s also saw electronic music begin to have a significant influence on popular music, with the adoption of polyphonic synthesizers, electronic drums, drum machines, and turntables, through the emergence of genres such as disco, krautrock, new wave, synth-pop, hip hop, and EDM. In the early 1980s mass-produced digital synthesizers, such as the Yamaha DX7, became popular, and MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) was developed. In the same decade, with a greater reliance on synthesizers and the adoption of programmable drum machines, electronic popular music came to the fore. During the 1990s, with the proliferation of increasingly affordable music technology, electronic music production became an established part of popular culture. In Berlin starting in 1989, the Love Parade became the largest street party with over 1 million visitors, inspiring other such popular celebrations of electronic music.
                            Contemporary electronic music includes many varieties and ranges from experimental art music to popular forms such as electronic dance music. Pop electronic music is most recognizable in its 4/4 form and more connected with the mainstream than preceding forms which were popular in niche markets.
                            At the turn of the 20th century, experimentation with emerging electronics led to the first electronic musical instruments. These initial inventions were not sold, but were instead used in demonstrations and public performances. The audiences were presented with reproductions of existing music instead of new compositions for the instruments. While some were considered novelties and produced simple tones, the Telharmonium synthesized the sound of several orchestral instruments with reasonable precision. It achieved viable public interest and made commercial progress into streaming music through telephone networks.
                            Critics of musical conventions at the time saw promise in these developments. Ferruccio Busoni encouraged the composition of microtonal music allowed for by electronic instruments. He predicted the use of machines in future music, writing the influential Sketch of a New Esthetic of Music (1907). Futurists such as Francesco Balilla Pratella and Luigi Russolo began composing music with acoustic noise to evoke the sound of machinery. They predicted expansions in timbre allowed for by electronics in the influential manifesto The Art of Noises (1913)."

            "name" => "Rock music",
            "description" => "Rock is a broad genre of popular music that originated as 'rock and roll' in the United States in the late 1940s and early 1950s, developing into a range of different styles from the mid-1960s, particularly in the U.S. and the United Kingdom. It has its roots in 1940s and 1950s rock and roll, a style that drew directly from the blues and rhythm and blues genres of African-American music and from country music. Rock also drew strongly from genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz, classical, and other musical styles. For instrumentation, rock has centered on the electric guitar, usually as part of a rock group with electric bass guitar, drums, and one or more singers. Usually, rock is song-based music with a time signature using a verse-chorus form, but the genre has become extremely diverse. Like pop music, lyrics often stress romantic love but also address a wide variety of other themes that are frequently social or political. Rock was the most popular genre of music in the U.S. and much of the Western world from the 1950s to the 2010s.
                            Rock musicians in the mid-1960s began to advance the album ahead of the single as the dominant form of recorded music expression and consumption, with the Beatles at the forefront of this development. Their contributions lent the genre a cultural legitimacy in the mainstream and initiated a rock-informed album era in the music industry for the next several decades. By the late 1960s 'classic rock' period, a number of distinct rock music subgenres had emerged, including hybrids like blues rock, folk rock, country rock, southern rock, raga rock, and jazz rock, which contributed to the development of psychedelic rock, influenced by the countercultural psychedelic and hippie scene. New genres that emerged included progressive rock with extended artistic elements, glam rock, highlighting showmanship and visual style, and the diverse and enduring subgenre of heavy metal, with emphasis on volume, power, and speed. In the second half of the 1970s, punk rock reacted by producing stripped-down, energetic social and political critiques. Punk was an influence in the 1980s on new wave, post-punk and eventually alternative rock.
                            From the 1990s, alternative rock began to dominate rock music and break into the mainstream in the form of grunge, Britpop, and indie rock. Further fusion subgenres have since emerged, including pop-punk, electronic rock, rap rock, and rap metal. Some movements were conscious attempts to revisit rock's history, including the garage rock/post-punk revival in the 2000s. Since the 2010s, rock has lost its position as the pre-eminent popular music genre in world culture, but remains commercially successful. The increased influence of hip-hop and electronic dance music can be seen in rock music, notably in the techno-pop scene of the early 2010s and the pop-punk-hip-hop revival of the 2020s.
                            Rock has also embodied and served as the vehicle for cultural and social movements, leading to major subcultures including mods and rockers in the U.K., the hippie movement and the wider Western counterculture movement that spread out from San Francisco in the U.S. in the 1960s, the latter of which continues to this day. Similarly, 1970s punk culture spawned the goth, punk, and emo subcultures. Inheriting the folk tradition of the protest song, rock music has been associated with political activism as well as changes in social attitudes to race, sex, and drug use, and is often seen as an expression of youth revolt against adult consumerism and conformity. At the same time, it has been commercially highly successful, leading to charges of selling out."

            "description" => "Pop music is a genre of popular music that originated in its modern form during the mid-1950s in the United States and the United Kingdom. During the 1950s and 1960s, pop music encompassed rock and roll and the youth-oriented styles it influenced. Rock and pop music remained roughly synonymous until the late 1960s, after which pop became associated with music that was more commercial, ephemeral, and accessible.
                            Identifying factors of pop music usually include repeated choruses and hooks, short to medium-length songs written in a basic format (often the verse-chorus structure), and rhythms or tempos that can be easily danced to. Much pop music also borrows elements from other styles such as rock, urban, dance, Latin, and country.
                            The terms popular music and pop music are often used interchangeably, although the former more accurately describes all music that is popular and includes many disparate styles. Although much of the music that appears on record charts is considered to be pop music, the genre is distinguished from chart music.
                            David Hatch and Stephen Millward describe pop music as 'a body of music which is distinguishable from popular, jazz, and folk music'. According to Pete Seeger, pop music is 'professional music which draws upon both folk music and fine arts music'. David Boyle, a music researcher, states pop music as any type of music that a person has been exposed to by the mass media. Most individuals think that pop music is just the singles charts and not the sum of all chart music. The music charts contain songs from a variety of sources, including classical, jazz, rock, and novelty songs. As a genre, pop music is seen to exist and develop separately. Therefore, the term 'pop music' may be used to describe a distinct genre, designed to appeal to all, often characterized as 'instant singles-based music aimed at teenagers' in contrast to rock music as 'album-based music for adults'.
                            Pop music continuously evolves along with the term's definition. According to music writer Bill Lamb, popular music is defined as 'the music since industrialization in the 1800s that is most in line with the tastes and interests of the urban middle class.' The term 'pop song' was first used in 1926, in the sense of a piece of music 'having popular appeal'. Hatch and Millward indicate that many events in the history of recording in the 1920s can be seen as the birth of the modern pop music industry, including in country, blues, and hillbilly music.
                            According to the website of The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, the term 'pop music' 'originated in Britain in the mid-1950s as a description for rock and roll and the new youth music styles that it influenced'. The Oxford Dictionary of Music states that while pop's 'earlier meaning meant concerts appealing to a wide audience [...] since the late 1950s, however, pop has had the special meaning of non-classical music, usually in the form of songs, performed by such artists as The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, ABBA, etc.' Grove Music Online also states that '[...] in the early 1960s, [the term] 'pop music' competed terminologically with beat music [in England], while in the US its coverage overlapped (as it still does) with that of 'rock and roll'.
                            From about 1967, the term 'pop music' was increasingly used in opposition to the term rock music, a division that gave generic significance to both terms. While rock aspired to authenticity and an expansion of the possibilities of popular music, pop was more commercial, ephemeral, and accessible. According to British musicologist Simon Frith, pop music is produced 'as a matter of enterprise not art', and is 'designed to appeal to everyone' but 'doesn't come from any particular place or mark off any particular taste'. Frith adds that it is 'not driven by any significant ambition except profit and commercial reward [...] and, in musical terms, it is essentially conservative'. It is, 'provided from on high (by record companies, radio programmers, and concert promoters) rather than being made from below... Pop is not a do-it-yourself music but is professionally produced and packaged'."

            "name" => "Hip Pop music",
            "description" => "Hip hop or hip-hop, also known as rap, and formerly known as disco rap, is a genre of popular music that originated in the early 1970s by African Americans in the Bronx, a borough of New York City. It existed for several years prior to mainstream discovery. Hip-hop music originated as an anti-drug and anti-violence genre consisting of stylized rhythmic music (usually built around drum beats) that often accompanies rapping, a rhythmic delivery of poetic speech. According to the professor Asante of African American studies at Temple University, 'hip hop is something that blacks can unequivocally claim as their own'. The music developed as part of the broader hip hop culture, a subculture defined by four key stylistic elements: MCing/rapping, DJing/scratching with turntables, break dancing, and graffiti art. While often used to refer solely to rapping and rap music, 'hip hop' more properly denotes the practice of the entire subculture. The term hip hop music is sometimes used synonymously with the term rap music, though rapping is not a required component of hip hop music; the genre may also incorporate other elements of the culture, including DJing, turntablism, scratching, beatboxing, and instrumental tracks.
                            Hip hop as both a musical genre and a culture was formed during the 1970s when block parties became increasingly popular in New York City, particularly among African American youth residing in the Bronx. At block parties, DJs played percussive breaks of popular songs using two turntables and a DJ mixer to be able to play breaks from two copies of the same record, alternating from one to the other and extending the 'break'. Hip hop's early evolution occurred as sampling technology and drum machines became widely available and affordable. Turntablist techniques such as scratching and beatmatching developed along with the breaks. Rapping developed as a vocal style in which the artist speaks or chants along rhythmically with an instrumental or synthesized beat.
                            Hip hop music was not officially recorded for play on radio or television until 1979, largely due to poverty during the genre's birth and lack of acceptance outside ghetto neighborhoods. Old-school hip hop was the first mainstream wave of the genre, marked by its disco influence and party-oriented lyrics. The 1980s marked the diversification of hip hop as the genre developed more complex styles and spread around the world. New-school hip hop was the genre's second wave, marked by its electro sound, and led into golden age hip hop, an innovative period between the mid-1980s and mid-1990s that also developed hip hop's own album era. The gangsta rap subgenre, focused on the violent lifestyles and impoverished conditions of inner-city African American youth, gained popularity at this time. West Coast hip hop was dominated by G-funk in the early-mid 1990s, while East Coast hip hop was dominated by jazz rap, alternative hip hop, and hardcore hip hop. Hip hop continued to diversify at this time with other regional styles emerging, such as Southern rap and Atlanta hip hop. Hip hop became a best-selling genre in the mid-1990s and the top-selling music genre by 1999.
                            The popularity of hip hop music continued through the late 1990s to early-2000s 'bling era' with hip hop influences increasingly finding their way into other genres of popular music, such as neo soul, nu metal, and R&B. The United States also saw the success of regional styles such as crunk, a Southern genre that emphasized the beats and music more than the lyrics, and alternative hip hop began to secure a place in the mainstream, due in part to the crossover success of its artists. During the late 2000s and early 2010s 'blog era', rappers were able to build up a following through online methods of music distribution, such as social media and blogs, and mainstream hip hop took on a more melodic, sensitive direction following the commercial decline of gangsta rap. The trap and mumble rap subgenres have become the most popular form of hip hop during the mid-late 2010s and early 2020s. In 2017, rock music was usurped by hip hop as the most popular genre in the United States."

            "name" => "Jazz",
            "description" => "Jazz is a music genre that originated in the African-American communities of New Orleans, Louisiana, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with its roots in blues and ragtime. Since the 1920s Jazz Age, it has been recognized as a major form of musical expression in traditional and popular music. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, complex chords, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in European harmony and African rhythmic rituals.
                            As jazz spread around the world, it drew on national, regional, and local musical cultures, which gave rise to different styles. New Orleans jazz began in the early 1910s, combining earlier brass band marches, French quadrilles, biguine, ragtime and blues with collective polyphonic improvisation. But jazz did not begin as a single musical tradition in New Orleans or elsewhere. In the 1930s, arranged dance-oriented swing big bands, Kansas City jazz (a hard-swinging, bluesy, improvisational style), and gypsy jazz (a style that emphasized musette waltzes) were the prominent styles. Bebop emerged in the 1940s, shifting jazz from danceable popular music toward a more challenging 'musician's music' which was played at faster tempos and used more chord-based improvisation. Cool jazz developed near the end of the 1940s, introducing calmer, smoother sounds and long, linear melodic lines.
                            The mid-1950s saw the emergence of hard bop, which introduced influences from rhythm and blues, gospel, and blues to small groups and particularly to saxophone and piano. Modal jazz developed in the late 1950s, using the mode, or musical scale, as the basis of musical structure and improvisation, as did free jazz, which explored playing without regular meter, beat and formal structures. Jazz-rock fusion appeared in the late 1960s and early 1970s, combining jazz improvisation with rock music's rhythms, electric instruments, and highly amplified stage sound. In the early 1980s, a commercial form of jazz fusion called smooth jazz became successful, garnering significant radio airplay. Other styles and genres abound in the 21st century, such as Latin and Afro-Cuban jazz.
                            The origin of the word jazz has resulted in considerable research, and its history is well documented. It is believed to be related to jasm, a slang term dating back to 1860 meaning 'pep, energy'. The earliest written record of the word is in a 1912 article in the Los Angeles Times in which a minor league baseball pitcher described a pitch which he called a 'jazz ball' 'because it wobbles and you simply can't do anything with it'.
                            The use of the word in a musical context was documented as early as 1915 in the Chicago Daily Tribune. Its first documented use in a musical context in New Orleans was in a November 14, 1916, Times-Picayune article about 'jas bands'. In an interview with National Public Radio, musician Eubie Blake offered his recollections of the slang connotations of the term, saying: 'When Broadway picked it up, they called it 'J-A-Z-Z'. It wasn't called that. It was spelled 'J-A-S-S'. That was dirty, and if you knew what it was, you wouldn't say it in front of ladies.' The American Dialect Society named it the Word of the 20th Century.
                            Jazz is difficult to define because it encompasses a wide range of music spanning a period of over 100 years, from ragtime to rock-infused fusion. Attempts have been made to define jazz from the perspective of other musical traditions, such as European music history or African music. But critic Joachim-Ernst Berendt argues that its terms of reference and its definition should be broader, defining jazz as a 'form of art music which originated in the United States through the confrontation of the Negro with European music' and arguing that it differs from European music in that jazz has a 'special relationship to time defined as 'swing''. Jazz involves 'a spontaneity and vitality of musical production in which improvisation plays a role' and contains a 'sonority and manner of phrasing which mirror the individuality of the performing jazz musician'.
                            A broader definition that encompasses different eras of jazz has been proposed by Travis Jackson: 'it is music that includes qualities such as swing, improvising, group interaction, developing an 'individual voice', and being open to different musical possibilities'. Krin Gibbard argued that 'jazz is a construct' which designates 'a number of musics with enough in common to be understood as part of a coherent tradition'. Duke Ellington, one of jazz's most famous figures, said, 'It's all music.'"

        "House" => [
            "name" => "House music",
            "description" => "House is a music genre characterized by a repetitive four-on-the-floor beat and a typical tempo of 120 beats per minute as a re-emergence of 1970's disco. It was created by DJs and music producers from Chicago's underground club culture and evolved slowly in the early/mid 1980s, and as DJs began altering disco songs to give them a more mechanical beat. By early 1988, House became mainstream and supplanted the typical 80s music beat.
                            House was created and pioneered by DJs and producers in Chicago such as Frankie Knuckles, Ron Hardy, Jesse Saunders, Chip E., Joe Smooth, Steve 'Silk' Hurley, Farley 'Jackmaster' Funk, Marshall Jefferson, Phuture, and others. House music initially expanded internationally, to London, then to other American cities, such as New York City, and ultimately a worldwide phenomenon.
                            House has a large influence on pop music, especially dance music. It was incorporated into works by major international artists including Whitney Houston, Janet Jackson, Madonna, Pet Shop Boys, Kylie Minogue and Lady Gaga, and also produced many mainstream hits such as 'Pump Up the Jam' by Technotronic, 'French Kiss' by Lil Louis, 'Show Me Love' by Robin S., and 'Push the Feeling On' by the Nightcrawlers. Many house DJs also did and continue to do remixes for pop artists. House music has remained popular on radio and in clubs while retaining a foothold on the underground scenes across the globe.
                            In its most typical form, the genre is characterized by repetitive 4/4 rhythms including bass drums, off-beat hi-hats, snare drums, claps, and/or snaps at a tempo of between 120 and 130 beats per minute (bpm); synthesizer riffs; deep basslines; and often, but not necessarily, sung, spoken or sampled vocals. In house, the bass drum is usually sounded on beats one, two, three, and four, and the snare drum, claps, or other higher-pitched percussion on beats two and four. The drum beats in house music are almost always provided by an electronic drum machine, often a Roland TR-808, TR-909, or a TR-707. Claps, shakers, snare drum, or hi-hat sounds are used to add syncopation. One of the signature rhythm riffs, especially in early Chicago house, is built on the clave pattern. Congas and bongos may be added for an African sound, or metallic percussion for a Latin feel.
                            Sometimes, the drum sounds are 'saturated' by boosting the gain to create a more aggressive edge. One classic subgenre, acid house, is defined through the squelchy sounds created by the Roland TB-303 bass synthesizer. House music could be produced on 'cheap and consumer-friendly electronic equipment' and used sound gear, which made it easier for independent labels and DJs to create tracks. The electronic drum machines and other gear used by house DJs and producers were formerly considered 'too cheap-sounding' by 'proper' musicians. House music producers typically use sampled instruments, rather than bringing session musicians into a recording studio. Even though a key element of house production is layering sounds, such as drum machine beats, samples, synth basslines, and so on, the overall 'texture...is relatively sparse'. Unlike pop songs, which emphasize higher-pitched sounds like melody, in house music, the lower-pitched bass register is most important.
                            House tracks typically involve an intro, a chorus, various verse sections, a midsection, and a brief outro. Some tracks do not have a verse, taking a vocal part from the chorus and repeating the same cycle. House music tracks are often based on eight-bar sections which are repeated. They are often built around bass-heavy loops or basslines produced by a synthesizer and/or around samples of disco, soul, jazz-funk, or funk songs. DJs and producers creating a house track to be played in clubs may make a 'seven or eight-minute 12-inch mix'; if the track is intended to be played on the radio, a 'three-and-a-half-minute' radio edit is used. House tracks build up slowly, by adding layers of sound and texture, and by increasing the volume.
                            House tracks may have vocals like a pop song, but some are 'completely minimal instrumental music'. If a house track does have vocals, the vocal lines may also be simple 'words or phrases' that are repeated."

            "name" => "Progressive house",
            "description" => "Progressive house is a subgenre of house music. The progressive house style emerged in the early 1990s. It initially developed in the United Kingdom as a natural progression of North American and European house music of the late 1980s.
                            In the context of popular music the word 'progressive' was first used widely in the 1970s to differentiate experimental forms of rock music from mainstream styles. Such music attempted to explore alternate approaches to rock music production. Some acts also attempted to elevate the aesthetic values of rock music by incorporating features associated with classical instrumental music. This led to a style of music called progressive rock, which has been described as 'the most self-consciously arty branch of rock.'
                            In disco music, and later house music, a similar desire to separate more exploratory styles from standard approaches saw DJs and producers adopting the word 'progressive' to make a distinction.[citation needed] According to the DJ and producer Carl Craig, the term 'progressive' was used in Detroit in the early 1980s in reference to Italo disco. The music was dubbed 'progressive' because it drew upon the influence of Giorgio Moroder's Euro disco rather than the disco inspired by the symphonic sound of Philadelphia soul. In Detroit, prior to the emergence of techno, artists like Alexander Robotnick, Klein + M.B.O. and Capricorn filled a vacancy left after disco's demise in America. In the late 1980s, UK music journalist Simon Reynolds introduced the term 'progressive dance' to describe acts such as 808 State, The Orb, Bomb the Bass and The Shamen. Between 1990 and 1992, the term 'progressive' referred to the short-form buzz word for the house music subgenre 'progressive house'.
                            Progressive house emerged after the first wave of house music. The roots of progressive house can be traced back to the early 1990s rave and club scenes in the United Kingdom. In 1992, Mixmag described it at the time as a 'new breed of hard but tuneful, banging but thoughtful, uplifting and trancey British house.' A combination of US house, UK house, Italian house, Polish house, German house, and techno largely influenced one another during this era. The term was used mainly as a marketing label to differentiate new rave house from traditional American house. Progressive house was a departure from the Chicago acid house sound. The buzz word emerged from the rave scene around 1990 to 1992, describing a new sound of house that broke away from its American roots. Progressive house was viewed by some as anti-rave as its popularity rose in English clubs while breakbeat hardcore flourished at raves. According to DJ Dave Seaman, the sound faced a backlash in the early 1990s because 'it had gone the same way as progressive rock before it. Pompous, po-faced and full of its own self importance. But basically was really quite boring.' The label progressive house was often used interchangeably with trance in the early years. The record label Bedrock Records released a series of 'Bedrock's 'Compiled and Mixed' albums featuring artists like Chris Fortier, John Creamer & Stephane K. Australian artist, Luke Chable has been known for his 2003 seminal remix release PQM's 'You Are Sleeping', titled 'You Are Sleeping (Luke Chable Vocal Pass)'.
                            AllMusic says that progressive house 'led the increasingly mainstream-sounding house from the charts back to the dance floors'."

            "name" => "Trance music",
            "description" => "Trance is a genre of electronic dance music that emerged from EBM in Frankfurt, Germany, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and quickly spread throughout Europe.
                            Trance music is typically characterized by a tempo between 120-150 beats per minute (BPM), repeating melodic phrases and a musical form that distinctly builds tension and elements throughout a track often culminating in 1 to 2 'peaks' or 'drops'. Although trance is a genre of its own, it liberally incorporates influences from other musical styles such as techno, house, chill-out, classical music, tech house, ambient and film scores.
                            A trance is a state of hypnotism and heightened consciousness. This is portrayed in trance music by the mixing of layers with distinctly foreshadowed build-up and release. A common characteristic of modern trance music is a mid-song climax followed by a soft breakdown disposing of beats and percussion entirely, leaving the melody or atmospherics to stand alone for an extended period before gradually building up again. Trance tracks are often lengthy to allow for such progression and commonly have sufficiently sparse opening and closing sections to facilitate mixing by DJs.
                            Trance is mostly instrumental, although vocals can be mixed in: typically they are performed by mezzo-soprano to soprano female soloists, mostly without a traditional verse/chorus structure. Structured vocal form in trance music forms the basis of the vocal trance subgenre, which has been described as 'grand, soaring, and operatic' and 'ethereal female leads floating amongst the synths'. However, male singers, such as Jonathan Mendelsohn, are also featured.
                            The earliest years of Trance were defined by Frankfurt labels such as Eye Q, Harthouse, Fax +49-69/450464, Force Inc., and others. Producers such as Pete Namlook, Oliver Lieb, and Rolf Ellmer created noteworthy tracks such as 'Eternal Spirit' by 4Voice, 'Hearts' by L.S.G., and 'We Came In Peace' by Dance 2 Trance.
                            Much of the development of trance can be traced to Sven Vath, who was heavily influenced by his experiences traveling to Goa where DJs were using psychedelic rock and other sounds to induce a trance state at beach parties. Vath, Dag Lerner, and Torsten Fenslau had an affection for hypnotic dance sounds and the music at Dorian Gray and Omen began to reflect this.
                            Vath launched Eye Q with Heinz Roth and Matthias Hoffman in 1991, followed by Harthouse in 1992, releasing some of the most well-known trance tracks of the era. Eye Q took a softer approach to trance with records such as Cygnus X's 'The Orange Theme,' Brainchild's 'Symmetry' and Vernon's 'Wonderer.' Harthouse focused on a harder trance sound with tracks such as Quicksand by Spicelab, Spectrum by Metal Master, Human by Resistance D, and Acperience by Hardfloor. The sound of Frankfurt was the sound of trance. DJ Dag Lerner, one half of Dance to Trance has stated that he was the first to call his music trance and 'gave the child his name.' The genre got its name from the trance-like state the music attempted to emulate in the 1990s before the genre's focus changed.
                            In a 2006 interview with Resident Advisor, Sven Vath acknowledged the role of his labels Eye Q and Harthouse in helping to create what people know as trance music today, going on to say that 'people are getting a wrong interpretation of what trance music is all about' and differentiating his own form from modern forms saying 'They are following a format -- always producing the same structure. It's a pop format for trance.'
                            As German Trance made its way back to Goa, a new subgenre emerged that was more organic in sound with an oriental aesthetic in its melodies, often with references to Eastern philosophy. Goa trance would go on to spawn many sub-genres of its own, including psytrance, psybreaks, and others.
                            In 1991 in Berlin, MFS Records began to gain a trance profile, signing Mijk van Dijk, Cosmic Baby, and Paul van Dyk, soon releasing some of the most well-known early trance tracks such as Love Stimulation by Humate and Perfect Day by Visions of Shiva, as well as perhaps the first ever trance compilation, Tranceformed From Beyond. While writer Bom Coen traces the roots of trance to Paul van Dyk's 1993 remix of Humate's 'Love Stimulation', there is little evidence to support this contention. In fact, van Dyk's own Trance roots can be traced further back to his work with Visions of Shiva, van Dyk's trance project with Cosmic Baby coming earlier. Early on, Paul van Dyk had been relatively sidelined on the scene, but his collaboration with Cosmic Baby quickly led him into the heart of the scene.
                            In the UK, the British approach to trance music and house music was similar: progressive chord structures, crescendos, longer breakdowns, and more organic instruments. In 1993 Platipus Records was launched by Simon Berry as an outlet for Barry's various projects, including Union Jack, Clanger, Art of Trance. Platipus would become one of the most consequential progressive trance labels. Another influential label of progressive trance was Hooj Choons with notable trance releases from artists Tilt, Oliver Lieb, Solarstone, as well as the well-known Three N' One remix of Cafe Del Mar by Energy 52.
                            In Germany, a harder sub-genre of trance emerged. With a faster tempo and gated pads, hard trance introduced the breakdown-build-anthem template that would become nearly ubiquitous in later trance sub-genres. Hard trance would inspire hardhouse, hard uplifting, jumpstyle, NRG, and hardstyle. Perhaps the best known label for this subgenre of trance was Bonzai Records, a sublabel of Lightning Records with notable tracks including Jones & Stephenson's The First Rebirth, Cherry Moon Trax's The House of House, Blue Alphabet's Cybertrance to name a few.
                            By the late 1990s, uplifting took over the scene with its fast tempo, characteristic builds, long breakdowns and big drops. In the early 2000s, pop-style vocals began being added into the music. The development of another subgenre, epic trance, finds some of its origins in classical music, with film music also being influential. Trance was arguably at its commercial peak in the second part of 1990s and early 2000s. Afterwards, popular trance music providers such as Armin van Buuren's A State of Trance, Paul van Dyk, and Above & Beyond remained popular, while lesser known DJs changed to other sounds. In 2017 a new wave of underground DJs such as Nina Kraviz began incorporating trance music into their sets.
                            In 2023, an effort by John 00 Fleming and others led Beatport to split their trance genre category into two: Trance (Main Floor) and Trance (Raw/Deep/Hypnotic). The latter designed for the underground side of the genre."

        "New Wave" => [
            "name" => "New wave music",
            "description" => "New wave is a music genre that encompasses pop-oriented styles from the late 1970s through the 1980s. It is considered a lighter and more melodic 'broadening of punk culture'. It was originally used as a catch-all for the various styles of music that emerged after punk rock, including punk itself. Later, critical consensus favored 'new wave' as an umbrella term involving many popular music styles of the era, including power pop, synth-pop, alternative dance, and specific forms of punk that were less abrasive. It may also be viewed as a more accessible counterpart of post-punk.
                            A number of common characteristics of new wave music include a humorous or quirky pop approach, angular guitar riffs, jerky rhythms, the use of electronics along with a distinctive visual style in fashion and music videos. In the early 1980s, virtually every new pop and rock act - and particularly those that employed synthesizers - were tagged as 'new wave' in the United States. Although new wave shares punk's do-it-yourself philosophy, the musicians were more influenced by the styles of the 1950s along with the lighter strains of 1960s pop and were opposed to the generally abrasive, political bents of punk rock, as well as what was considered to be creatively stagnant 'corporate rock'.
                            New wave commercially peaked from the late 1970s into the early 1980s with numerous major musicians and an abundance of one-hit wonders. MTV, which was launched in 1981, heavily promoted new-wave acts, boosting the genre's popularity. In the mid-1980s, new wave declined with the emergence of the New Romantic, New Pop, and New Music genres. Since the 1990s, new wave resurged several times with the growing nostalgia for several new-wave-influenced musicians.
                            New wave music encompassed a wide variety of styles that shared a quirky, lighthearted, and humorous tone that were very popular in the late 1970s and 1980s. New wave includes several pop-oriented styles from this time period. Common characteristics of new wave music include a humorous or quirky pop approach, the use of electronic sounds, and a distinctive visual style in music videos and fashion. According to Simon Reynolds, new wave music had a twitchy, agitated feel. New wave musicians often played choppy rhythm guitars with fast tempos; keyboards, and stop-start song structures and melodies are common. Reynolds noted new-wave vocalists sound high-pitched, geeky, and suburban.
                            As new wave originated in Britain, many of the first new wave artists were British. These bands became popular in America, in part, because of channels like MTV, which would play British new wave music videos because most American hit records did not have music videos to play. British videos, according to head of S-Curve Records and music producer Steve Greenberg, 'were easy to come by since they'd been a staple of UK pop music TV programs like 'Top of the Pops' since the mid-70s.' This rise in technology made the visual style of new wave musicians important for their success.
                            The majority of American, male, new wave acts of the late 1970s were from white, middle-class backgrounds. Scholar Theo Cateforis said these acts intentionally presented these exaggerated, nerdy tendencies associated with their 'whiteness' to criticize it and to reflect their identity. A nervous, nerdy persona was a common characteristic of new wave fans, and acts such as Talking Heads, Devo, and Elvis Costello. This took the forms of robotic dancing, jittery high-pitched vocals, and clothing fashions that hid the body such as suits and big glasses. This seemed radical to audiences accustomed to post-counterculture genres such as disco dancing and macho 'cock rock' that emphasized a 'hang loose' philosophy, open sexuality, and sexual bravado.
                            Although new wave shares punk's do-it-yourself artistic philosophy, the musicians were more influenced by the light strains of 1960s pop while opposed to mainstream 'corporate' rock, which they considered creatively stagnant, and the generally abrasive and political bents of punk rock. In the early 1980s, particularly in the United States, notable new wave acts embraced a crossover of pop and rock music with African and African-American styles. Adam and the Ants and Bow Wow Wow, both acts with ties to former Sex Pistols manager Malcolm McLaren, used Burundi-style drumming. Talking Heads' album Remain in Light was marketed and positively reviewed as a breakthrough melding of new wave and African styles, although drummer Chris Frantz said he found out about this supposed African influence after the fact. As the decade continued, new wave elements would be adopted by African-American musicians such as Grace Jones, Janet Jackson, and Prince, who in particular used new wave influences to lay the groundwork for the Minneapolis sound."

            "name" => "Electro music",
            "description" => "Electro (or electro-funk) is a genre of electronic music and early hip hop directly influenced by the use of the Roland TR-808 drum machines and funk. Records in the genre typically feature heavy electronic sounds, usually without vocals, although if vocals are present they are delivered in a deadpan manner, often through electronic distortion such as vocoding and talkboxing. It palpably deviates from its predecessor boogie by being less vocal-oriented and more focused on electronic beats produced by drum machines.
                            Following the decline of disco music in the United States, electro emerged as a fusion of funk and early hip-hop with principal influences from New York boogie, German and Japanese electronic pop music. The genre emerged with musicians Arthur Baker, Afrika Bambaataa, Warp 9, and Hashim. Seminal electro tracks included 'Planet Rock' (1982) and 'Nunk' (1982), both featuring its characteristic TR-808 drum beats.
                            The early 1980s were electro's mainstream peak. By the mid 1980s, the genre moved away from its electronic and funk influences, using harder edged beats and rock samples, exemplified by Run DMC. Electro became popular again in the late 1990s with artists such as Anthony Rother and DJs such as Dave Clarke. A third wave of popularity occurred in 2007. Electro has branched out into subgenres, including electrocore and skweee.
                            From its inception, one of the defining characteristics of the electro sound was the use of drum machines, particularly the Roland TR-808, as the rhythmic basis of the track. As the genre evolved, computers and sampling replaced drum machines in electronic music, and are now used by the majority of electro producers. It is important to note, that although the electro of the 1980s and contemporary electro (electronic dance music) both grew out of the dissolution of disco, they are now different genres.
                            Classic (1980s) electro drum patterns tend to be electronic emulations of breakbeats with a syncopated kick drum, and usually a snare or clap accenting the backbeat. The difference between electro drumbeats and breakbeats (or breaks) is that electro tends to be more mechanical, while breakbeats tend to have more of a human-like feel, like that of a live drummer. The definition however is somewhat ambiguous in nature due to the various uses of the term.
                            The Roland TR-808 drum machine was released in 1980, defining early electro with its immediately recognizable sound. Staccato, percussive drumbeats tended to dominate electro, almost exclusively provided by the TR-808. As an inexpensive way of producing a drum sound, the TR-808 caught on quickly with the producers of early electro because of the ability of its bass drum to generate extreme low-frequencies. This aspect of the Roland TR-808 was especially appealing to producers who would test drive their tracks in nightclubs (like NYC's Funhouse), where the bass drum sound was essential for a record's success. Its unique percussion sounds like handclaps, open and closed high-hat, clave and cowbell became integral to the electro sound. A number of popular songs in the early 1980s employed the TR-808, including Marvin Gaye's âSexual Healing,â Cybotron's âClear,â and Afrika Bambaataa's âPlanet Rock.â The Roland TR-808 has attained iconic status, eventually being used on more hits than any other drum machine. Through the use of samples, the Roland TR-808 remains popular in electro and other genres to the present day.
                            Other electro instrumentation was generally electronic, favoring analog synthesis, programmed bass lines, sequenced or arpeggiated synthetic riffs, and atonal sound effects all created with synthesizers. Heavy use of effects such as reverbs, delays, chorus or phasers along with eerie synthetic ensemble strings or pad sounds emphasized the science fiction or futuristic themes of classic (1980s) electro, represented in the lyrics and/or music. Electro hip hop group Warp 9's 1983 single, Light Years Away, produced and written by Lotti Golden and Richard Scher, exemplifies the Sci-Fi, afrofuturist aspect of electro, reflected in both the lyrics and instrumentation. The imagery of its lyrical refrain space is the place for the human race pays homage to Sun Ra's 1974 film of the same name, while its synth lines and sound effects are informed by sci-fi, computer games, and cartoons,'born of a science-fiction revival.'.
                            Most electro is instrumental, but a common element is vocals processed through a vocoder. Additionally, speech synthesis may be used to create robotic or mechanical lyrical content, as in the iconic Planet Rock and the automatous chant in the chorus of Nunk by Warp 9. Although primarily instrumental, early electro utilized rap. Male rap dominated the genre, however female rappers are an integral part of the electro tradition, whether featured in a group as in Warp 9 or as solo performers like Roxanne Shante. The lyrical style that emerged along with electro became less popular by the 1990s, as rapping continued to evolve, becoming the domain of hip hop music."

            "description" => "Electronic body music (EBM) is a genre of electronic music that combines elements of industrial music and synth-punk with elements of dance music. It developed in the early 1980s in Western Europe, as an outgrowth of both the punk and the industrial music cultures. It combines sequenced repetitive basslines, programmed dance music rhythms, and mostly undistorted vocals and command-like shouts with confrontational or provocative themes.
                            The evolution of the genre reflected 'a general shift towards more song-oriented structures in industrial as to a general turn towards the dancefloor by many musicians and genres in the era of post-punk.' It was considered a part of the European new wave and post-punk movement and the first style that blended synthesized sounds with an ecstatic style of dancing (e.g. pogo).
                            EBM gained a stable following in the second half of the 1980s. Around that period, a youth-cultural scene emerged from EBM whose followers describe themselves as EBM-heads or (in North America) as rivetheads.
                            The term electronic body music was first used by Ralf HÃ¼tter of the German electronic band Kraftwerk in an interview with British music newspaper Sounds in November 1977. In June 1978 HÃ¼tter reused the phrase in an interview with WKSU radio (Kent, Ohio) to explain the more physical character of the Kraftwerk album The Man-Machine. Although the term originated in the late 1970s, it was not until the 1980s when it reappeared and started to come into popular use.
                            Described as an outgrowth of 'electronically generated punk [music] intertwined with industrial sounds,' EBM has been characterized as a composite of programmed drum beats, repetitive basslines, and clear or slightly distorted vocals, instructional shouts or growls complemented with reverberation and echo effects.Typical EBM rhythms rely on the 4/4 beat or rock-oriented backbeats, (featuring kick drum, snare and hi-hat) and some minor syncopation."

Emerging in the late 1980s, gangsta rap's pioneers include Schoolly D of Philadelphia and Ice-T of Los Angeles, later expanding in California with artists such as N.W.A and Tupac Shakur. In 1992, via record producer and rapper Dr. Dre, rapper Snoop Dogg, and their G-funk sound, gangster rap broadened to mainstream popularity.
                            Gangsta rap has been recurrently accused of promoting disorderly conduct and broad criminality, especially assault, homicide, and drug dealing, as well as misogyny, promiscuity, and materialism. Gangsta rap's defenders have variously characterized it as artistic depictions but not literal endorsements of real life in American ghettos, or suggested that some lyrics voice rage against social oppression or police brutality, and have often accused critics of hypocrisy and racial bias. Still, gangsta rap has been assailed even by some black public figures, including Spike Lee, pastor Calvin Butts and activist C. Delores Tucker."

            "description" => "Hardcore hip hop (also hardcore rap) is a subgenre of hip hop music that developed through the East Coast hip hop scene in the 1980s. Pioneered by such artists as Run-DMC, Schoolly D, Boogie Down Productions and Public Enemy, it is generally characterized by anger, aggression and confrontation.
                            Music experts have credited Run-DMC as the first hardcore hip hop group. Other early artists to adopt an aggressive style were Schoolly D in Philadelphia and Too Short in Oakland. Before a formula for gangsta rap had developed, artists such as Boogie Down Productions and Ice-T wrote lyrics based on detailed observations of 'street life', while the confrontational and aggressive lyrics and chaotic, rough production style of Public Enemy's records set new standards for hardcore hip hop and hip hop production. Though initially a largely East Coast phenomenon, by the late 1980s, hardcore rap increasingly became largely synonymous with West Coast gangsta rap, with artists like N.W.A infusing 'gangsta' themed stories of gritty gang life.
                            In the early 1990s, hardcore hip hop again became associated with the East Coast as Wu-Tang Clan emerged with minimalistic beats and piano-driven sampling, which became widely popular among other hardcore hip hop artists of the time. In the early, late 90s and early 2000s, other New York based artists like Onyx, DMX and M.O.P. incorporated yelling in their lyrics. In the 2010s, punk rap combined elements of hardcore hip hop and hardcore punk, with artists like Denzel Curry at the forefront.
                            Gangsta rap has often been associated with the hardcore hip hop style, and gangsta rap is generally considered a subgenre or offshoot of hardcore hip hop. However, not all hardcore hip hop revolves around 'gangsta' lyrical themes, despite the considerable overlap between the two genres, especially within hardcore rappers of the 1990s. Hardcore hip hop is characterised by aggression and confrontation and generally describes violence or anger. Russell Potter wrote that while hardcore rap has been associated with a 'monolithic 'gangsta' outlook' by the popular press, hardcore rappers have 'laid claim to a wide variety of ground'."

            "name" => "Deep house",
            "description" => "Deep house is a subgenre of house music that originated in the 1980s, initially fusing elements of Chicago house with the lush chords of 1980s jazz-funk and touches of soul music. Its origins are attributed to the early recordings of Larry Heard (aka Mr. Fingers), including his influential track 'Can You Feel It'.
                            Deep house is known for tempos typically from 110 to 125 bpm muted basslines, spacious use of percussion elements (typically using a Roland TR-909 drum machine), soft keyboard sounds (pads), use of advanced chord structures, ambient mixes, and soulful vocals.
                            Deep house was largely pioneered by Chicago producers such as Marshall Jefferson (On the House) and Larry Heard (Mr. Fingers) and with tracks such as 'Mystery of Love' (1985) and 'Can You Feel It?' (1986); the latter had a similar impact on deep house to that of Derrick May's 'Strings of Life' (1987) on Detroit techno. The jazzy sound became more common due to the favored use of gentler, more organic (yet still synthesizer based) production and instrument sounds. Author Richie Unterberger has stated that Heard's deep house sound moved house music away from its posthuman tendencies back towards the lush, soulful sound of early disco music (particularly that of old Philadelphia International and Salsoul records). 'Can You Feel It' became a deep house blueprint; Heard used a Roland Juno-60 synthesizer to create the deep bassline, along with a Roland TR-909 drum machine for the beats. DJ Ron Trent stated that the term was initially used to describe the DJ work of Frankie Knuckles and Ron Hardy, who departed from a strictly electronic house sound to incorporate eclectic elements like disco, jazz, and underground music.
                            In the 2000s and 2010s, the genre remained very popular. By around Aug 2014, however, the perception of the genre was resulting in a sense that some house music was being labeled deep inappropriately, and the term has since been used to encapsulate various types of bassline-driven house music, later named Brazilian bass or slap house, as the genre evolves from its historical origins."

        "Italo-Disco" => [
            "name" => "Italo disco",
            "description" => "Italo disco (variously capitalized, and sometimes hyphenated as Italo-disco) is a music genre which originated in Italy in the late 1970s and was mainly produced in the early 1980s. Italo disco evolved from the then-current underground dance, pop, and electronic music, both domestic and foreign (American hi-NRG, French Euro disco) and developed into a diverse genre. The genre employs electronic drums, drum machines, synthesizers, and occasionally vocoders. It is usually sung in English, and to a lesser extent in Italian and Spanish.
                            The origin of the genre's name is strongly tied to marketing efforts of the ZYX record label, which began licensing and marketing the music outside Italy in 1982. Italo disco faded in the early 1990s and then split into many genres (Eurobeat, Italo house, Italo dance).
                            The term 'Italo', a generic prefix meaning Italian, had been used on pop music compilation albums in Germany as early as 1978, such as Italo Top Hits on the K-Tel label and the first volume of Italo Super Hits on the Ariola label.
                            There is no documentation of where the term 'Italo-Disco' first appeared, but its origins are generally traced to Italian and other European disco recordings released in the German market. Examples include the phrase 'Original Italo-Disco' on the sleeve of the German edition of 'Girls on Me' by Amin-Peck in 1982, and the 1983 compilation album The Best of Italo-Disco. These records, along with the Italo Boot Mix megamix, were released by Bernhard Mikulski on his ZYX label, who was therefore credited with coining the term 'Italo disco'. The Best of and Boot Mix compilations each became a 16-volume series that culminated in 1991. Both series primarily featured disco music of Italian origin, often licensed from independent Italian labels which had limited distribution outside Italy, as well as songs in a similar style by other European artists.
                            The presenters of the Italian music show Discoring (produced by RAI) usually referred to Italo disco tracks as 'rock elettronico' (electronic rock) or 'balli da discoteca' (disco dance) before the term 'Italo disco' came into existence.
                            Italo disco originated in Europe in the late 1970s. After Disco Demolition Night in 1979, American interest in disco sharply declined, whereas in Europe the genre maintained mainstream popularity and survived into the 1980s.
                            The adoption of synthesizers and other electronic instruments by disco artists led to electronic dance music, which spawned many subgenres such as hi-NRG in America and space disco in Europe. Italo disco's influences include Italian producer Giorgio Moroder, French musician Didier Marouani, French drummer Cerrone, and the San Francisco-based hi-NRG producer Patrick Cowley, who worked with singers as Sylvester and Paul Parker.
                            In the late 1970s, Italo disco group D. D. Sound (La Bionda) released the song '1, 2, 3, 4, Gimme Some More'. In 1979, Jacques Fred Petrus and Mauro Malavasi created the soulful post-disco groups Change and B. B. & Q. Band. In 1981, both groups gained US R&B and Dance hits with 'Paradise' and 'On the Beat' respectively.
                            Italo disco often features electronic sounds, electronic drums, drum machines, catchy melodies, vocoders, overdubs, and heavily accented English lyrics. By 1983, Italo disco's instrumentation was predominantly electronic. Along with love, Italo disco themes deal with robots and space, sometimes combining all three in songs like 'Robot Is Systematic' (1982) by Lectric Workers and 'Spacer Woman' (1983) by Charlie.
                            In 1983, there were frequent hit singles, and labels such as American Disco, Crash, Merak, Sensation and X-Energy appeared. The popular label Discomagic Records released more than thirty singles within the year. It was also the year that the term 'Italo disco' became widely known outside Italy, with the release of the first volumes of The Best of Italo Disco compilation series on the German record label ZYX. After 1983, Italo disco was also produced outside Italy.
                            Although Italo disco was successful in mainland Europe during the 1980s, only few singles reached the UK charts, such as Ryan Paris's 'Dolce Vita', Laura Branigan's 'Self Control', Baltimora's 'Tarzan Boy', Spagna's 'Call Me' and Sabrina's 'Boys', all of which were top 5 hits. Italo disco maintained an influence in the UK's underground music scenes in the UK, and its impact can be heard in the music of several British electronic acts such as the Pet Shop Boys, Erasure and New Order."

            "name" => "Techno",
            "description" => "Techno is a genre of electronic dance music (EDM) which is generally produced for use in a continuous DJ set, with tempo often varying between 120 and 150 (as per Marcello Perri) beats per minute (bpm). The central rhythm is typically in common time (4/4) and often characterized by a repetitive four on the floor beat. Artists may use electronic instruments such as drum machines, sequencers, and synthesizers, as well as digital audio workstations. Drum machines from the 1980s such as Roland's TR-808 and TR-909 are highly prized, and software emulations of such retro instruments are popular.
                            Much of the instrumentation in techno emphasizes the role of rhythm over other musical parameters. Techno tracks mainly progress over manipulation of timbral characteristics of synthesizer presets and, unlike forms of EDM that tend to be produced with synthesizer keyboards, techno does not always strictly adhere to the harmonic practice of Western music and such structures are often ignored in favor of timbral manipulation alone. Another distinguishing feature of techno music and techno aesthetic is the general embracement of creative use of music production technology.
                            Use of the term 'techno' to refer to a type of electronic music originated in Germany in the early 1980s. In 1988, following the UK release of the compilation Techno! The New Dance Sound of Detroit, the term came to be associated with a form of EDM produced in Detroit. Detroit techno resulted from the melding of synth-pop by artists such as Kraftwerk, Giorgio Moroder and Yellow Magic Orchestra with African American styles such as house, electro, and funk. Added to this is the influence of futuristic and science-fiction themes relevant to life in contemporary American society, with Alvin Toffler's book The Third Wave a notable point of reference. The music produced in the mid-to-late 1980s by Juan Atkins, Derrick May, and Kevin Saunderson (collectively known as The Belleville Three), along with Eddie Fowlkes, Blake Baxter, James Pennington and others is viewed as the first wave of techno from Detroit.
                            After the success of house music in a number of European countries, techno grew in popularity in the UK, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands. In Europe regional variants quickly evolved and by the early 1990s techno subgenres such as acid, hardcore, bleep, ambient, and dub techno had developed. Music journalists and fans of techno are generally selective in their use of the term, so a clear distinction can be made between sometimes related but often qualitatively different styles, such as tech house and trance.
                            In exploring Detroit techno's origins, writer Kodwo Eshun maintains that 'Kraftwerk are to techno what Muddy Waters is to the Rolling Stones: the authentic, the origin, the real.' Juan Atkins has acknowledged that he had an early enthusiasm for Kraftwerk and Giorgio Moroder, particularly Moroder's work with Donna Summer and the producer's own album E=MC2. Atkins also mentions that 'around 1980 I had a tape of nothing but Kraftwerk, Telex, Devo, Giorgio Moroder and Gary Numan, and I'd ride around in my car playing it.' Regarding his initial impression of Kraftwerk, Atkins notes that they were 'clean and precise' relative to the 'weird UFO sounds' featured in his seemingly 'psychedelic' music.
                            Derrick May identified the influence of Kraftwerk and other European synthesizer music in commenting that 'it was just classy and clean, and to us it was beautiful, like outer space. Living around Detroit, there was so little beauty... everything is an ugly mess in Detroit, and so we were attracted to this music. It, like, ignited our imagination!'. May has commented that he considered his music a direct continuation of the European synthesizer tradition. He also identified Japanese synthpop act Yellow Magic Orchestra, particularly member Ryuichi Sakamoto, and British band Ultravox, as influences, along with Kraftwerk. YMO's song 'Technopolis' (1979), a tribute to Tokyo as an electronic mecca, is considered an 'interesting contribution' to the development of Detroit techno, foreshadowing concepts that Atkins and Davis would later explore with Cybotron.
                            Kevin Saunderson has also acknowledged the influence of Europe but he claims to have been more inspired by the idea of making music with electronic equipment: 'I was more infatuated with the idea that I can do this all myself.'
                            These early Detroit techno artists additionally employed science fiction imagery to articulate their visions of a transformed society."

            "name" => "Acid house",
            "description" => "Acid house (also simply known as just 'acid') is a subgenre of house music developed around the mid-1980s by DJs from Chicago. The style is defined primarily by the squelching sounds and basslines of the Roland TB-303 electronic bass synthesizer-sequencer, an innovation attributed to Chicago artists Phuture and Sleezy D circa 1986.
                            Acid house soon became popular in the United Kingdom and continental Europe, where it was played by DJs in the acid house and later rave scenes. By the late 1980s, acid house had moved into the British mainstream, where it had some influence on pop and dance styles.
                            Acid house brought house music to a worldwide audience. The influence of acid house can be heard in later styles of dance music including trance, hardcore, jungle, big beat, techno and trip hop.
                            Acid house's minimalist sound combined house music's ubiquitous programmed four-on-the-floor 4/4 beat with the electronic squelch sound produced by the Roland TB-303 electronic synthesizer-sequencer. The sound is commonly produced by raising the filter resonance and lowering the cutoff frequency of the synthesizer, along with programming the 303's accent, slide, and octave parameters, to create variation in otherwise simple bass patterns. 'Exploration of texture' is preferred over melody; 'a refusal of the metaphysical priorities of western music discourse.' Other elements, such as synthetic strings and stabs, were usually minimal. Sometimes tracks were instrumentals such as Phuture's 'Acid Tracks', or contained full vocal performances such as Pierre's Pfantasy Club's 'Fantasy Girl', while others were essentially instrumentals complemented by the odd spoken word 'drop-in', such as Phuture's 'Slam'.
                            There are conflicting accounts about the origin of the term acid. One self claimed account by members of Phuture points to their own 'Acid Tracks'. Before the song was given a title for commercial release, it was played by DJ Ron Hardy at a nightclub where psychedelic drugs were reportedly used. The club's patrons called the song 'Ron Hardy's Acid Track' (or 'Ron Hardy's Acid Trax'). The song was released with the title 'Acid Tracks' on Larry Sherman's label Trax Records in 1987. Sources differ on whether it was Phuture or Sherman who chose the title; Phuture's DJ Pierre says the group did because the song was already known by that title, but DJ Pierre says he chose the title because the song reminded him of acid rock. Regardless, after the release of Phuture's song, the term acid house came into common parlance.
                            Some accounts say the reference to 'acid' may be a celebratory reference to psychedelic drugs in general, such as LSD, as well as the popular club drug Ecstasy (MDMA). According to Rietveld, it was the house sensibility of Chicago, in a club like Hardy's The Music Box, that afforded it its initial meaning. In her view 'acid connotes the fragmentation of experience and dislocation of meaning due to the unstructuring effects on thought patterns which the psychedelic drug LSD or 'Acid' can bring about. In the context of the creation of 'Acid Tracks' it indicated a concept rather than the use of psychedelic drugs in itself.
                            Some accounts disavow psychedelic connotations. One theory, holding that acid was a derogatory reference towards the use of samples in acid house music, was repeated in the press and in the British House of Commons. In this theory, the term acid came from the slang term 'acid burning,' which the Oxford Dictionary of New Words calls 'a term for stealing.' In 1991, UK Libertarian advocate Paul Staines claimed that he had coined this theory to discourage the government from adopting anti-rave party legislation.
                            The name of acid jazz is derived from that of acid house, which served as one of the inspirations for the genre's development."

            "name" => "Breakbeat",
            "description" => "Breakbeat is a broad type of electronic music that tends to use drum breaks sampled from early recordings of funk, jazz, and R&B. Breakbeats have been used in styles such as hip hop, jungle, drum and bass, big beat, breakbeat hardcore, and UK garage styles (including 2-step, breakstep and dubstep).
                            The origin of the word 'breakbeat' is the fact that the drum loops that were sampled occurred during a 'break' in the music - for example the Amen break (a drum solo from 'Amen, Brother' by The Winstons) or the Think Break (from 'Think (About It)' by Lyn Collins).
                            The tempo of breaks tracks, ranging from 110 to 150 beats per minute, allows DJs to mix breaks with a wide range of different genres in their sets. This has led to breakbeats being used in many hip hop, jungle/drum & bass and hardcore tracks. They can also be heard in other music, anywhere from popular music to background music in car and clothing commercials on radio or TV.
                            With the advent of digital sampling and music editing on the computer, breakbeats have become much easier to create and use. Now, instead of cutting and splicing tape sections or constantly backspinning two records at the same time, a computer program can be used to cut, paste, and loop breakbeats endlessly. Digital effects such as filters, reverb, reversing, time stretching and pitch shifting can be added to the beat, and even to individual sounds by themselves. Individual instruments from within a breakbeat can be sampled and combined with others, thereby creating wholly new breakbeat patterns."

            "description" => "Synth-pop (short for synthesizer pop; also called techno-pop) is a music genre that first became prominent in the late 1970s and features the synthesizer as the dominant musical instrument. It was prefigured in the 1960s and early 1970s by the use of synthesizers in progressive rock, electronic, art rock, disco, and particularly the Krautrock of bands like Kraftwerk. It arose as a distinct genre in Japan and the United Kingdom in the post-punk era as part of the new wave movement of the late 1970s.
                            Electronic musical synthesizers that could be used practically in a recording studio became available in the mid-1960s, and the mid-1970s saw the rise of electronic art musicians. After the breakthrough of Gary Numan in the UK Singles Chart in 1979, large numbers of artists began to enjoy success with a synthesizer-based sound in the early 1980s. In Japan, Yellow Magic Orchestra introduced the TR-808 rhythm machine to popular music, and the band would be a major influence on early British synth-pop acts. The development of inexpensive polyphonic synthesizers, the definition of MIDI and the use of dance beats, led to a more commercial and accessible sound for synth-pop. This, its adoption by the style-conscious acts from the New Romantic movement, together with the rise of MTV, led to success for large numbers of British synth-pop acts in the US during the Second British Invasion.
                            The term 'techno-pop' was coined by Yuzuru Agi in his critique of Kraftwerk's The Man-Machine in 1978 and is considered a case of multiple discovery of naming. Hence, the term can be used interchangeably to 'synth-pop' but generally used to the scene of Japan and is a preferred term there. The term 'techno-pop' became also popular in Europe, where it started: German band Kraftwerk's 1986 album was titled Techno Pop; English band the Buggles has a song named 'Technopop' and Spanish band Mecano described their style as tecno-pop.
                            'Synth-pop' is sometimes used interchangeably with 'electropop', but 'electropop' may also denote a variant of synth-pop that places more emphasis on a harder, more electronic sound. In the mid to late 1980s, duos such as Erasure and Pet Shop Boys adopted a style that was highly successful on the US dance charts, but by the end of the decade, the synth-pop of bands such as A-ha and Alphaville was giving way to house music and techno. Interest in synth-pop began to revive in the indietronica and electroclash movements in the late 1990s, and in the 2000s synth-pop enjoyed a widespread revival and commercial success.
                            The genre has received criticism for alleged lack of emotion and musicianship; prominent artists have spoken out against detractors who believed that synthesizers themselves composed and played the songs. Synth-pop music has established a place for the synthesizer as a major element of pop and rock music, directly influencing subsequent genres (including house music and Detroit techno) and has indirectly influenced many other genres, as well as individual recordings.
                            Synth-pop is defined by its primary use of synthesizers, drum machines and sequencers, sometimes using them to replace all other instruments. Borthwick and Moy have described the genre as diverse but 'characterised by a broad set of values that eschewed rock playing styles, rhythms and structures', which were replaced by 'synthetic textures' and 'robotic rigidity', often defined by the limitations of the new technology, including monophonic synthesizers (only able to play one note at a time).
                            Many synth-pop musicians had limited musical skills, relying on the technology to produce or reproduce the music. The result was often minimalist, with grooves that were 'typically woven together from simple repeated riffs often with no harmonic 'progression' to speak of'. Early synth-pop has been described as 'eerie, sterile, and vaguely menacing', using droning electronics with little change in inflection. Common lyrical themes of synth-pop songs were isolation, urban anomie, and feelings of being emotionally cold and hollow.
                            In its second phase in the 1980s, the introduction of dance beats and more conventional rock instrumentation made the music warmer and catchier and contained within the conventions of three-minute pop. Synthesizers were increasingly used to imitate the conventional and clichÃ©d sound of orchestras and horns. Thin, treble-dominant, synthesized melodies and simple drum programmes gave way to thick, and compressed production, and a more conventional drum sound. Lyrics were generally more optimistic, dealing with more traditional subject matter for pop music such as romance, escapism and aspiration. According to music writer Simon Reynolds, the hallmark of 1980s synth-pop was its 'emotional, at times operatic singers' such as Marc Almond, Alison Moyet and Annie Lennox. Because synthesizers removed the need for large groups of musicians, these singers were often part of a duo where their partner played all the instrumentation.
                            Although synth-pop in part arose from punk rock, it abandoned punk's emphasis on authenticity and often pursued a deliberate artificiality, drawing on the critically derided forms such as disco and glam rock. It owed relatively little to the foundations of early popular music in jazz, folk music or the blues, and instead of looking to America, in its early stages, it consciously focused on European and particularly Eastern European influences, which were reflected in band names like Spandau Ballet and songs like Ultravox's 'Vienna'. Later synth-pop saw a shift to a style more influenced by other genres, such as soul music."

        "Minimal" => [
            "name" => "Minimal music",
            "description" => "Minimal music (also called minimalism) is a form of art music or other compositional practice that employs limited or minimal musical materials. Prominent features of minimalist music include repetitive patterns or pulses, steady drones, consonant harmony, and reiteration of musical phrases or smaller units. It may include features such as phase shifting, resulting in what is termed phase music, or process techniques that follow strict rules, usually described as process music. The approach is marked by a non-narrative, non-teleological, and non-representational approach, and calls attention to the activity of listening by focusing on the internal processes of the music.
                            The approach originated in the New York Downtown scene of the 1960s and was initially viewed as a form of experimental music called the New York Hypnotic School. In the Western art music tradition, the American composers Moondog, La Monte Young, Terry Riley, Steve Reich, and Philip Glass are credited with being among the first to develop compositional techniques that exploit a minimal approach. The movement originally involved dozens of composers, although only five (Young, Riley, Reich, Glass, and later John Adams) emerged to become publicly associated with American minimal music; other lesser known pioneers included Dennis Johnson, Terry Jennings, Richard Maxfield, Pauline Oliveros, Phill Niblock, and James Tenney. In Europe, the music of Louis Andriessen, Karel Goeyvaerts, Michael Nyman, Howard Skempton, Ãliane Radigue, Gavin Bryars, Steve Martland, Henryk GÃ³recki, Arvo PÃ¤rt and John Tavener exhibits minimalist traits.
                            It is unclear where the term minimal music originates. Steve Reich has suggested that it is attributable to Michael Nyman, an assertion that two scholars, Jonathan Bernard, and Dan Warburton, have also made in writing. Philip Glass believes Tom Johnson coined the phrase.
                            According to Richard E. Rodda, ''Minimalist' music is based upon the repetition of slowly changing common chords [chords that are diatonic to more than one key, or else triads, either just major, or major and minorâsee: common tone] in steady rhythms, often overlaid with a lyrical melody in long, arching phrases...[It] utilizes repetitive melodic patterns, consonant harmonies, motoric rhythms, and a deliberate striving for aural beauty.' Timothy Johnson holds that, as a style, minimal music is primarily continuous in form, without disjunct sections. A direct consequence of this is an uninterrupted texture made up of interlocking rhythmic patterns and pulses. It is in addition marked by the use of bright timbres and an energetic manner. Its harmonic sonorities are distinctively simple, usually diatonic, often consist of familiar triads and seventh chords, and are presented in a slow harmonic rhythm. Johnson disagrees with Rodda, however, in finding that minimal music's most distinctive feature is the complete absence of extended melodic lines. Instead, there are only brief melodic segments, thrusting the organization, combination, and individual characteristics of short, repetitive rhythmic patterns into the foreground.
                            Minimal music has had some influence on developments in popular music. The experimental rock act The Velvet Underground had a connection with the New York down-town scene from which minimal music emerged, rooted in the close working relationship of John Cale and La Monte Young, the latter influencing Cale's work with the band. Terry Riley's album A Rainbow in Curved Air (1969) was released during the era of psychedelia and flower power, becoming the first minimalist work to have crossover success, appealing to rock and jazz audiences. Music theorist Daniel Harrison coined the Beach Boys' Smiley Smile (1967) an experimental work of 'protominimal rock', elaborating: '[The album] can almost be considered a work of art music in the Western classical tradition, and its innovations in the musical language of rock can be compared to those that introduced atonal and other nontraditional techniques into that classical tradition.' The development of specific experimental rock genres such as krautrock, space rock (from the 1980s), noise rock, and post-rock was influenced by minimal music."

        "Downtempo" => [
            "name" => "Downtempo",
            "description" => "Downtempo (or downbeat) is a broad label for electronic music that features an atmospheric sound and slower beats than would typically be found in dance music. Closely related to ambient music but with greater emphasis on rhythm, the style may be played in chillout clubs or as 'warm-up or cool-down' music during a DJ set. Examples of downtempo subgenres include trip hop, ambient house, chillwave, psybient and lo-fi hip hop.
                            The style emerged in the late 1980s with the UK's Bristol scene that birthed artists like Massive Attack, Portishead, and Tricky. In the 1990s, the style was heard internationally in artists such as Kruder & Dorfmeister, Fila Brazillia, and Thievery Corporation. Other prominent artists to emerge in the style include Underworld, Orbital, Fluke, Boards of Canada, Nicolas Jaar, and Bonobo.
                            Downtempo music is a broad genre but is united by several characteristics:
                                - Atmospheric sound: artists focus more on layered sounds and mood than on catchy melodies or riffs
                                - Slow beats: songs typically feature beats around 90 BPM
                                - Gentle melodies: artists typically include more melodic phrases than straightforward ambient music
                            Downtempo emerged from the UK's late-1980s Bristol sound, which developed a slow, psychedelic fusion of hip hop with electronic music known as 'trip hop' and birthed artists such as Massive Attack, Portishead, and Tricky. The 1990s brought on a wave of slower paced music which was played throughout chillout roomsâthe relaxation sections of the clubs or dedicated sections at electronic music events. UK act Nightmares on Wax helped to pioneer downtempo electronica in the early 1990s, drawing on dub reggae and hip-hop. Downtempo music also started to surface around Ibiza, when DJs and promoters would bring down the vibe with slower rhythm and gentler electronic music upon approaching sunrise. At the end of the 1990s a more melodic instrumental electronica incorporating acoustic sounds with electronic styles emerged under its own umbrella name of downtempo.
                            In the late 1990s, the Austrian duo Kruder & Dorfmeister popularized the style with their downtempo remixes of pop, hip-hop, and drum and bass tracks with influences of the '70s soul jazz. Britons Steve Cobby and Dave McSherry, producing under the name Fila Brazillia, released a handful of downtempo, electronica and ambient techno albums that propelled the style further. Meanwhile, the Washington, D.C. locals Eric Hilton and Rob Garza, better known as Thievery Corporation, have introduced the Brazilian sound into the style after discussing the music of Antonio Carlos Jobim, and enriched it further by combining elements of Jamaican dub and reggae.
                            In 2010, 'downtempo pop' was described by The Atlantic as a variety of music styles from the 2000s characterized by mellow beats, vintage synthesizers, and lo-fi melodies. In other words, an umbrella term that includes chillwave, glo-fi, and hypnagogic pop. Later in the decade, another form of downtempo music, tagged as 'lo-fi hip hop' or 'chillhop', became popular among YouTube music streamers."

            "name" => "Experimental music",
            "description" => "Experimental music is a general label for any music or music genre that pushes existing boundaries and genre definitions. Experimental compositional practice is defined broadly by exploratory sensibilities radically opposed to, and questioning of, institutionalized compositional, performing, and aesthetic conventions in music. Elements of experimental music include indeterminacy, in which the composer introduces the elements of chance or unpredictability with regard to either the composition or its performance. Artists may approach a hybrid of disparate styles or incorporate unorthodox and unique elements.
                            The practice became prominent in the mid-20th century, particularly in Europe and North America. John Cage was one of the earliest composers to use the term and one of experimental music's primary innovators, utilizing indeterminacy techniques and seeking unknown outcomes. In France, as early as 1953, Pierre Schaeffer had begun using the term musique expÃ©rimentale to describe compositional activities that incorporated tape music, musique concrÃ¨te, and elektronische Musik. In America, a quite distinct sense of the term was used in the late 1950s to describe computer-controlled composition associated with composers such as Lejaren Hiller. Harry Partch and Ivor Darreg worked with other tuning scales based on the physical laws for harmonic music. For this music they both developed a group of experimental musical instruments. Musique concrÃ¨te is a form of electroacoustic music that utilises acousmatic sound as a compositional resource. Free improvisation or free music is improvised music without any rules beyond the taste or inclination of the musician(s) involved; in many cases, the musicians make an active effort to avoid clichÃ©s; i.e., overt references to recognizable musical conventions or genres.
                            The Groupe de Recherches de Musique ConcrÃ¨te (GRMC), under the leadership of Pierre Schaeffer, organized the First International Decade of Experimental Music between 8 and 18 June 1953. This appears to have been an attempt by Schaeffer to reverse the assimilation of musique concrÃ¨te into the German elektronische Musik, and instead tried to subsume musique concrÃ¨te, elektronische Musik, tape music, and world music under the rubric 'musique experimentale'. Publication of Schaeffer's manifesto was delayed by four years, by which time Schaeffer was favoring the term 'recherche musicale' (music research), though he never wholly abandoned 'musique expÃ©rimentale'.
                            John Cage was also using the term as early as 1955. According to Cage's definition, 'an experimental action is one the outcome of which is not foreseen', and he was specifically interested in completed works that performed an unpredictable action. In Germany, the publication of Cage's article was anticipated by several months in a lecture delivered by Wolfgang Edward Rebner at the DarmstÃ¤dter Ferienkurse on 13 August 1954, titled 'Amerikanische Experimentalmusik'. Rebner's lecture extended the concept back in time to include Charles Ives, Edgard VarÃ¨se, and Henry Cowell, as well as Cage, due to their focus on sound as such rather than compositional method."

        "Indie Rock" => [
            "name" => "Indie rock",
            "description" => "Indie rock is a subgenre of rock music that originated in the United Kingdom, United States and New Zealand in the early to mid-1980s. Although the term was originally used to describe rock music released through independent record labels, by the 1990s it became more widely associated with the music such bands produced.
                            The sound of indie rock has its origins in the New Zealand Dunedin sound of the Chills, Sneaky Feelings, Tall Dwarfs, the Clean and the Verlaines, and early 1980s college rock radio stations who would frequently play jangle pop bands like the Smiths and R.E.M. The genre solidified itself during the mid-1980s with NME's C86 cassette in the United Kingdom and the underground success of Sonic Youth, Dinosaur Jr. and Unrest in the United States. By this time, 'indie' had become used to refer to bands whose music was released on independent record labels, in addition to the record labels themselves. As the decade progressed many individual local scenes developed their own distinct takes on the genre: baggy in Manchester; grebo in Stourbridge and Leicester; and shoegaze in London and the Thames Valley.
                            During the 1990s, the mainstream success of grunge and Britpop, two movements influenced by indie rock, brought increased attention to the genre and saw record labels use their independent status as a marketing tactic. This led to a split within indie rock: one side conforming to mainstream radio; the other becoming increasingly experimental. By this point 'indie rock' referred to the musical style rather than ties to the independent music scene. During the decade, indie rock bands like Sonic Youth, the Pixies and Radiohead all released albums on major labels and subgenres like slowcore, Midwest emo, slacker rock and space rock began. In the 2000s, indie rock reentered the mainstream through the garage rock and post-punk revival and the influence of the Strokes and the Libertines. This success was exacerbated in the middle of the decade by Bloc Party, the Arctic Monkeys and the Killers and indie rock proliferated into the landfill indie movement.
                            The term indie rock, which comes from 'independent', describes the small and relatively low-budget labels on which it is released and the do-it-yourself attitude of the bands and artists involved. Although distribution deals are often struck with major corporate companies, these labels and the bands they host have attempted to retain their autonomy, leaving them free to explore sounds, emotions and subjects of limited appeal to large, mainstream audiences. The influences and styles of the artists have been extremely diverse, including punk, psychedelia, post-punk and country.
                            The lo-fi, experimental and art rock sound of the Velvet Underground as well as late 70s punk and post-punk bands such as the Fall, Buzzcocks, Wire,Television and Joy Division would be influential to the genre.
                            Allmusic identifies indie rock as including a number of 'varying musical approaches [not] compatible with mainstream tastes'. Linked by an ethos more than a musical approach, the indie rock movement encompassed a wide range of styles, from hard-edged, grunge-influenced bands, through do-it-yourself experimental bands like Pavement, to punk-folk singers such as Ani DiFranco. In his book DIY Style: Fashion, Music and Global Digital Cultures, Brent Luvaas described the genre as rooted in nostalgia, citing the influence of garage rock and psychedelic rock of the 1960s in progenitors the Stone Roses and the Smiths, in addition to a lyrical preoccupation with literature. In this same vein, Matthew Bannister defined indie rock as 'small groups of white men playing guitars, influenced by punks and 1960s white pop/rock, within a broader discourse and practice of (degrees of) independence from mainstream musical values.' According to anthropologist Wendy Fonarow, a key element of indie is the dichotomy between a 'puritan ethos' and a 'romantic one', with the former using austere ethics, and the latter being eccentric. This is best seen in the contrast between the indie music of United States and the United Kingdom in the 1990s, with British acts being flamboyant performers, while American acts used their lack of virtuosity as a mark of authenticity.
                            Indie rock is noted for having a relatively high proportion of female artists compared with preceding rock genres, a tendency exemplified by the development of the feminist-informed riot grrrl music of acts like Bikini Kill, Bratmobile, 7 Year Bitch, Team Dresch and Huggy Bear. However, Cortney Harding pointed out that this sense of equality is not reflected in the number of women running indie labels."

        "Post Rock" => [
            "name" => "Post-rock",
            "description" => "Post-rock is a form of experimental rock characterized by a focus on exploring textures and timbre over traditional rock song structures, chords, or riffs. Post-rock artists are often instrumental, typically combining rock instrumentation with electronics. The genre emerged within the indie and underground music scene of the 1980s and early 1990s. However, due to its abandonment of rock conventions, it often bears little resemblance musically to contemporary indie rock, borrowing instead from diverse sources including ambient, electronica, jazz, krautrock, dub, and minimalist classical.
                            Artists such as Talk Talk and Slint have been credited with producing foundational works in the style in the early 1990s. The term post-rock itself was notably employed by journalist Simon Reynolds in a review of the 1994 Bark Psychosis album Hex. It later solidified into a recognizable trend with the release of Tortoise's 1996 album Millions Now Living Will Never Die. The term has since been used to describe bands which differ widely in style, making the term controversial among listeners and artists alike.
                            The concept of 'post-rock' was developed by critic Simon Reynolds, who used the term in his review of Bark Psychosis' album Hex, published in the March 1994 issue of Mojo magazine. Reynolds expanded upon the idea later in the May 1994 issue of The Wire. Writing about artists like Seefeel, Disco Inferno, Techno Animal, Robert Hampson, and Insides, Reynolds used the term to describe music 'using rock instrumentation for non-rock purposes, using guitars as facilitators of timbre and textures rather than riffs and power chords'. He further expounded on the term, Reynolds, in a July 2005 entry in his blog, claimed he had used the concept of 'post-rock' before using it in Mojo, previously referencing it in a feature on the band Insides for music newspaper Melody Maker. He also said he later found the term itself not to be of his own coinage, saying in his blog, 'I discovered many years later it had been floating around for over a decade.' In 2021, Reynolds noted that the term had developed in meaning during the 21st century, no longer referring to 'left-field UK guitar groups engaged in a gradual process of abandoning songs [and exploring] texture, effects processing, and space,' but instead coming to signify 'epic and dramatic instrumental rock, not nearly as post- as it likes to think it is.'
                            Earlier uses of the term include its employment in a 1975 article by American journalist James Wolcott about musician Todd Rundgren, although with a different meaning. It was also used in the Rolling Stone Album Guide to name a style roughly corresponding to 'avant-rock' or 'out-rock'. The earliest use of the term cited by Reynolds dates back as far as September 1967. In a Time cover story feature on the Beatles, writer Christopher Porterfield hails the band and producer George Martin's creative use of the recording studio, declaring that this is 'leading an evolution in which the best of current post-rock sounds are becoming something that pop music has never been before an art form.' Another pre-1994 example of the term in use can be found in an April 1992 review of 1990s noise-pop band The Earthmen by Steven Walker in Melbourne music publication Juke, where he describes a 'post-rock noisefest'.
                            The post-rock sound incorporates characteristics from a variety of musical genres, including krautrock, ambient, psychedelia, prog rock, space rock, math rock, tape music, minimalist classical, British IDM, jazz (both avant-garde and cool), and dub reggae, as well as post-punk, free jazz, contemporary classical, and avant-garde electronica. It also bears similarities to drone music. Early post-rock groups also often exhibited strong influence from the krautrock of the 1970s, particularly borrowing elements of 'motorik', the characteristic krautrock rhythm.
                            Post-rock compositions often make use of repetition of musical motifs and subtle changes with an extremely wide range of dynamics. In some respects, this is similar to the music of Steve Reich, Philip Glass and Brian Eno, pioneers of minimalism. Typically, post-rock pieces are lengthy and instrumental, containing repetitive build-ups of timbre, dynamics and texture.
                            Vocals are often omitted from post-rock; however, this does not necessarily mean they are absent entirely. When vocals are included, the use is typically non-traditional: some post-rock bands employ vocals as purely instrumental efforts and incidental to the sound, rather than a more traditional use where 'clean', easily interpretable vocals are important for poetic and lyrical meaning. When present, post-rock vocals are often soft or droning and are typically infrequent or present in irregular intervals. Sigur RÃ³s, a band known for their distinctive vocals, fabricated a language they called 'Hopelandic' ('Vonlenska' in Icelandic), which they described as 'a form of gibberish vocals that fits to the music and acts as another instrument.'
                            In lieu of typical rock structures like the verse-chorus form, post-rock groups generally make greater use of soundscapes. Simon Reynolds states in his 'Post-Rock' from Audio Culture that 'A band's journey through rock to post-rock usually involves a trajectory from narrative lyrics to stream-of-consciousness to voice-as-texture to purely instrumental music'. Reynolds' conclusion defines the sporadic progression from rock, with its field of sound and lyrics to post-rock, where samples are stretched and looped.
                            Wider experimentation and blending of other genres have recently taken hold in the post-rock scene. Cult of Luna, Isis, Russian Circles, Palms, Deftones, and Pelican have fused metal with post-rock styles. The resulting sound has been termed post-metal. More recently, sludge metal has grown and evolved to include (and in some cases fuse completely with) some elements of post-rock. This second wave of sludge metal has been pioneered by bands such as Giant Squid and Battle of Mice. This new sound is often seen on the label of Neurot Recordings. Similarly, bands such as Altar of Plagues, LantlÃ´s and Agalloch blend between post-rock and black metal, incorporating elements of the former while primarily using the latter. In some cases, this sort of experimentation and blending has gone beyond the fusion of post-rock with a single genre, as in the case of post-metal, in favor of an even wider embrace of disparate musical influences as it can be heard in bands like Deafheaven."

            "name" => "Disco",
            "description" => "Disco is a genre of dance music and a subculture that emerged in the 1970s from the United States' urban nightlife scene. Its sound is typified by four-on-the-floor beats, syncopated basslines, string sections, brass and horns, electric piano, synthesizers, and electric rhythm guitars.
                            Disco started as a mixture of music from venues popular among African-Americans, Hispanic/Latino Americans, gay Americans, and Italian Americans in Philadelphia and New York City during the late 1960s to early 1970s. Disco can be seen as a reaction by the 1960s counterculture to both the dominance of rock music and the stigmatization of dance music at the time. Several dance styles were developed during the period of disco's popularity in the United States, including 'the Bump' and 'the Hustle'.
                            In the course of the 1970s, disco music was developed further, mainly by artists from the United States and Europe. Well-known artists included the Bee Gees, ABBA, Donna Summer, Gloria Gaynor, Giorgio Moroder, Baccara, Boney M., Earth Wind & Fire, Chaka Khan, Chic, KC and the Sunshine Band, Thelma Houston, Sister Sledge, Sylvester, The Trammps, Diana Ross, Kool & the Gang, and the Village People. While performers garnered public attention, record producers working behind the scenes played an important role in developing the genre. By the late 1970s, most major U.S. cities had thriving disco club scenes, and DJs would mix dance records at clubs such as Studio 54 in Manhattan, a venue popular among celebrities. Nightclub-goers often wore expensive, extravagant outfits, consisting predominantly of loose, flowing pants or dresses for ease of movement while dancing. There was also a thriving drug subculture in the disco scene, particularly for drugs that would enhance the experience of dancing to the loud music and the flashing lights, such as cocaine and quaaludes, the latter being so common in disco subculture that they were nicknamed 'disco biscuits'. Disco clubs were also associated with promiscuity as a reflection of the sexual revolution of this era in popular history. Films such as Saturday Night Fever (1977) and Thank God It's Friday (1978) contributed to disco's mainstream popularity.
                            Disco declined as a major trend in popular music in the United States following the infamous Disco Demolition Night on July 12, 1979, and it continued to sharply decline in popularity in the U.S. during the early 1980s; however, it remained popular in Italy and some European countries throughout the 1980s, and during this time also started becoming trendy in places elsewhere including India and the Middle East, where aspects of disco were blended with regional folk styles such as ghazals and belly dancing. Disco would eventually become a key influence in the development of electronic dance music, house music, hip hop, new wave, dance-punk, and post-disco. The style has had several revivals since the 1990s, and the influence of disco remains strong across American and European pop music. A revival has been underway since the early 2010s, coming to great popularity in the early 2020s. Albums that have contributed to this revival include Confessions on a Dance Floor, Random Access Memories, Future Nostalgia, and Kylie Minogue's album itself titled Disco.
                            The term 'disco' is shorthand for the word discothÃ¨que, a French word for 'library of phonograph records' derived from 'bibliothÃ¨que'. The word 'discothÃ¨que' had the same meaning in English in the 1950s.
                            'DiscothÃ¨que' became used in French for a type of nightclub in Paris, after they had resorted to playing records during the Nazi occupation in the early 1940s. Some clubs used it as their proper name. In 1960, it was also used to describe a Parisian nightclub in an English magazine.
                            In the summer of 1964, a short sleeveless dress called the 'discotheque dress' was briefly very popular in the United States. The earliest known use for the abbreviated form 'disco' described this dress and has been found in The Salt Lake Tribune on July 12, 1964, Playboy magazine used it in September of the same year to describe Los Angeles nightclubs.
                            Vince Aletti was one of the first to describe disco as a sound or a music genre. He wrote the feature article 'Discotheque Rock Paaaaarty' that appeared in Rolling Stone magazine in September 1973."

            "name" => "Intelligent dance music",
            "description" => "Intelligent dance music (IDM) is a style of electronic music originating in the early 1990s, defined by idiosyncratic experimentation rather than specific genre constraints. It emerged from the culture and sound palette of electronic and rave music styles such as ambient techno, acid house, Detroit techno and breakbeat; it has been regarded as better suited to home listening than dancing. Prominent artists associated with it include Four Tet, Aphex Twin, Autechre, Squarepusher, Venetian Snares, Boards of Canada, Amon Tobin, Telefon Tel Aviv, Î¼-Ziq, the Black Dog, the Future Sound of London, and Luke Vibert.
                            The term 'intelligent dance music' was likely inspired by the 1992 Warp compilation Artificial Intelligence and is said to have originated in the US in 1993 with the formation of the 'IDM list', an electronic mailing list originally chartered for the discussion of English artists appearing on the compilation. The term has been widely criticised and dismissed by most artists associated with it, including Aphex Twin, Autechre, and Î¼-Ziq. Rephlex Records, a label co-created by Aphex Twin, coined the term 'Braindance' as an alternative. In 2014, music critic Sasha Frere-Jones observed that the term 'is widely reviled but still commonly used'.
                            In the late 1980s, riding the wave of the acid house and early rave party scenes, UK-based groups such as The Orb and The KLF produced ambient house, a genre that fused house music (particularly acid house) with ambient music. By the early 1990s, the increasingly distinct music associated with dance music experimentation had gained prominence with releases on a variety of mostly UK-based record labels, including Warp (1989), Black Dog Productions (1989), R&S Records (1989), Carl Craig's Planet E, Rising High Records (1991), Richard James's Rephlex Records (1991), Kirk Degiorgio's Applied Rhythmic Technology (1991), Eevo Lute Muzique (1991), General Production Recordings (1989), Soma Quality Recordings (1991), Peacefrog Records (1991), and Metamorphic Recordings (1992).
                            In 1992, Warp released Artificial Intelligence, the first album in the Artificial Intelligence series. Subtitled 'electronic listening music from Warp', the record was a collection of tracks from artists such as Autechre, B12, Black Dog Productions, Aphex Twin and The Orb, under various aliases. This would help establish the ambient techno sound of the early 1990s. Steve Beckett, co-owner of Warp, has said the electronic music that the label was releasing then was targeting a post-club, home-listening audience. Following the success of the Artificial Intelligence series, 'intelligent techno' became the favoured term, although ambientâwithout a qualifying house or techno suffix, but still referring to a hybrid formâwas a common synonym.
                            In the same period (1992-93), other names were also used, such as 'art techno', 'armchair techno', and 'electronica', but all were attempts to describe an emerging offshoot of electronic dance music that was being enjoyed by the 'sedentary and stay at home'. At the same time, the UK market was saturated with increasingly frenetic breakbeat and sample-laden hardcore techno records that quickly became formulaic. Rave had become a 'dirty word', so as an alternative, it was common for London nightclubs to advertise that they were playing 'intelligent' or 'pure' techno, appealing to a 'discerning' crowd that considered the hardcore sound to be too commercial.
                            In 1993, a number of new 'intelligent techno'/'electronica' record labels emerged, including New Electronica, Mille Plateaux, and Ferox Records.
                            Warp's second Artificial Intelligence compilation was released in 1994. The album featured fragments of posts from the IDM mailing list incorporated into typographic artwork by The Designers Republic. Sleeve notes by David Toop acknowledged the genre's multitude of musical and cultural influences and suggested none should be considered more important than any other.
                            During this period, the electronic music produced by Warp Records artists such as Aphex Twin (an alias of Richard D. James), Autechre, LFO, B12, Seefeel and The Black Dog, gained popularity among electronic music fans, as did music by artists on the Rephlex and Skam labels. Lesser-known artists on the Likemind label and Kirk Degiorgio's A.R.T. and Op-Art labels, including Degiorgio himself under various names (As One, Future/Past and Esoterik), Steve Pickton (Stasis) and Nurmad Jusat (Nuron) also found an audience, along with bigger-name, cross-genre artists like BjÃ¶rk and Future Sound of London."

            "name" => "Pop rock",
            "description" => "Pop rock (also typeset as pop/rock) is a fusion genre characterized by a strong commercial appeal, with more emphasis on professional songwriting and recording craft, and less emphasis on attitude than standard rock music. Originating in the late 1950s as an alternative to normal rock and roll, early pop rock was influenced by the beat, arrangements, and original style of rock and roll (and sometimes doo-wop). It may be viewed as a distinct genre field rather than music that overlaps with pop and rock. The detractors of pop rock often deride it as a slick, commercial product and less authentic than rock music.
                            Much pop and rock music has been very similar in sound, instrumentation and even lyrical content. The terms 'pop rock' and 'power pop' have been used to describe more commercially successful music that uses elements from, or the form of, rock music. Writer Johan Fornas views pop/rock as 'one single, continuous genre field', rather than distinct categories. To the authors Larry Starr and Christopher Waterman, it is defined as an 'upbeat variety of rock music' represented by artists and bands such as: Andy Kim, the Bells, Paul McCartney, Lighthouse, and Peter Frampton.
                            The term pop has been used since the early fourties to refer to popular music in general, but from the mid-1950s it began to be used for a distinct genre, aimed at a youth market, often characterized as a softer alternative to rock and roll. In the aftermath of the British Invasion, from about 1967, it was increasingly used in opposition to the term rock, to describe a form that was more commercial, ephemeral and accessible.
                            As of the 2010s, 'guitar pop rock' and 'indie rock' are roughly synonymous terms. 'Jangle' is a noun-adjective that music critics often use in reference to guitar pop with a bright mood."
